msgstr "Oh, Ma-chan, sei tornato. Allora, com'è andata la cosa?"

msgctxt "100_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, I found the case report for the hit."
msgstr "Beh, ho trovato il verbale del caso per il colpo."

msgctxt "112_Zhao"
msgid "You did!? What did it say!?"
msgstr "Ce l'hai fatta!? Cosa ha detto!?"

msgctxt "124_Tanimura"
msgid "A lot of stuff I already knew, plus one new piece of info."
msgstr "Un sacco di roba che già sapevo, più un'informazione nuova."

msgctxt "136_Zhao"
msgid "Oh?"
msgstr "Oh?"

msgctxt "148_Tanimura"
msgid "Sugiuchi was investigating that case... along with my dad."
msgstr "Sugiuchi stava indagando su quel caso... insieme a mio padre."

msgctxt "160_Zhao"
msgid ""
"Sugiuchi? The same one that's always giving you hell back at the station?"
msgstr "Sugiuchi? Lo stesso che ti sta sempre addosso lì alla centrale?"

msgctxt "172_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Mhm. I've talked to him more times than I care to remember, but he never "
"once mentioned being on a case with my dad."
msgstr ""
"Mhm. Gli ho parlato più volte di quante voglia ricordare, ma non ha mai "
"accennato di aver lavorato a un caso con mio padre."

msgctxt "184_Tanimura"
msgid "And that's despite him knowing how bad I want the truth."
msgstr "E questo nonostante sappia quanto la voglio, 'sta verità."

msgctxt "196_Zhao"
msgid "......"
msgstr "......"

msgctxt "208_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"That's not the worst of it, either. I'm starting to believe someone on the "
"force did my father in."
msgstr ""
"E non è nemmeno la cosa peggiore. Comincio a credere che qualcuno della "
"polizia abbia fatto fuori mio padre."

msgctxt "220_Tanimura"
msgid "Katsuragi said as much when we met yesterday."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "232_Zhao"
msgid "Another officer... Things just keep getting better, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "244_Tanimura"
msgid "Seriously..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "256_Zhao"
msgid ""
"Why don't you call it a day, Ma-chan? Even you need to rest at some point."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "268_Tanimura"
msgid "...You're right. I think I'll knock out for a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "280_Zhao"
msgid "You do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "292_Zhao"
msgid "Hey, Mei Hua! Get Ma-chan's futon ready!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "340_Hisai"
msgid ""
"Either way, Tanimura-kun, that stunt you pulled had me worried half to "
"death!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "352_Hisai"
msgid ""
"I got a call from Sugiuchi-kun in Homicide telling me you were trying to "
"contact the Ueno Seiwa."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "364_Hisai"
msgid ""
"So I took it upon myself to search for you before you wound up in danger... "
"Which ended up happening anyway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "376_Tanimura"
msgid "Ahh, so that's why you're here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "388_Hisai"
msgid ""
"Tanimura-kun. You must have some inclination as to how dangerous the Ueno "
"Seiwa Clan is right now. Are you even aware of the gravity of this "
"situation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "400_Tanimura"
msgid "Eh, more or less."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "412_Hisai"
msgid "*sigh*"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "424_Zhao"
msgid ""
"Well, at least this Katsuragi seems to know something about your father's "
"killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "436_Zhao"
msgid "Sounds like progress to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "448_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "460_Zhao"
msgid "Then why the long face? You finally have a promising lead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "472_Tanimura"
msgid "Something that Katsuragi said has been bugging me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "484_Zhao"
msgid "And what was that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "496_Tanimura"
msgid "The police covered up the truth about the massacre in 1985."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "508_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"They knew the real killer was Katsuragi, but they pinned it all on Saejima."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "520_Zhao"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "532_Hisai"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "544_Tanimura"
msgid "None of this rings a bell, Chief?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "556_Hisai"
msgid ""
"No. I'm not in Homicide, and back then I was as low on the totem pole as it "
"gets."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "568_Tanimura"
msgid "Fair enough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "580_Zhao"
msgid "So were the police trying to protect Katsuragi? If so, why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "592_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Who knows? But they obviously couldn't let a scandal like that go public."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "604_Zhao"
msgid "Hrm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "628_Hisai"
msgid "...I just thought of something."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "640_Tanimura"
msgid "Hm?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "652_Hisai"
msgid "Maybe we could dig something up at headquarters."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "664_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh yeah? How?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "676_Hisai"
msgid ""
"Archive Room 13 on basement level 3...\r\n"
"The so-called Forbidden Room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "688_Zhao"
msgid "Forbidden Room!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "700_Hisai"
msgid "That's right. Also known as the \"Scandal Graveyard.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "712_Hisai"
msgid ""
"All records of police misconduct over the years supposedly end up there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "724_Hisai"
msgid "Or so the rumor goes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "736_Tanimura"
msgid "Interesting. Then we just might find something useful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "748_Hisai"
msgid "Yes. Or, well, it could all simply be a rumor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "760_Tanimura"
msgid "Still, worth a shot. In fact... I'm all over it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "772_Hisai"
msgid ""
"Now hold your horses, Tanimura-kun! Think about it. Archive 13 is smack-dab "
"in the middle of headquarters!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "784_Hisai"
msgid "A rookie like you can't just go strolling in there without permission."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "796_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"I never planned on asking. I mean, we're dealing with someone who can cover "
"up mass murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "808_Tanimura"
msgid "I doubt they'd be keen on giving me access to the evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "820_Zhao"
msgid "You serious about this, Ma-chan...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "832_Hisai"
msgid "Tanimura-kun, I... No, nothing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "844_Tanimura"
msgid "So. We all ready to go?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "856_Hisai"
msgid "Huh? Wait... \"We\" as in you and me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "868_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Of course! Us Community Safety boys gotta stick together, right? Besides, "
"I've only been to HQ maybe once or twice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "880_Tanimura"
msgid "I probably couldn't find this archive even if I tried."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "892_Tanimura"
msgid "But you know right where it is, don't you, Chief?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "904_Hisai"
msgid "What? No, I... Well, I mean, yes, but be that as it may..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "916_Tanimura"
msgid "Great! Then I'll be counting on you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "940_Zhao"
msgid "What!? You mean someone else killed those 18 men?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "952_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Right. The Ueno Seiwa officers were taken out by one of their own: "
"Katsuragi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "964_Zhao"
msgid "Then Yasuko Saejima's brother is innocent?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "976_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, he did carry out the attack, so he's far from innocent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "988_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"But there's a big difference in sentencing for murder and attempted murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1000_Zhao"
msgid "Hrm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1012_Hisai"
msgid "Was this Katsuragi also responsible for killing your father?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024_Tanimura"
msgid "I couldn't get an answer out of him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036_Hisai"
msgid "I see..."
msgstr ""
