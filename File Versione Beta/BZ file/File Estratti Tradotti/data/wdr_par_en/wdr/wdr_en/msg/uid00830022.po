msgstr ""

msgctxt "272_Tanimura"

msgid "I looked up all the detectives who ever worked a case with my dad, but none of their names started with \"K.\""

msgctxt "368_Tanimura"
msgid "And there's no file on Bridge, either. I think K and my dad were investigating Bridge off the record."

msgctxt "452_Tanimura"

msgctxt "524_Tanimura"
