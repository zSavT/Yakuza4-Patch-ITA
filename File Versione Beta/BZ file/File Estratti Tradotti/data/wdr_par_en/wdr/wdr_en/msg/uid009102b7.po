msgctxt "740_Komaki"

msgctxt "752_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Komaki"

msgctxt "1076_Komaki"

msgctxt "1088_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Komaki"

msgctxt "1112_Komaki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Kiryu"
msgid "It's... the Black Journal. You gave it to me before. Why do you have it now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Komaki"
msgid "Stop screwing around! I gave it to you and you just forgot it here at the dojo!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Komaki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Kiryu"
msgid "Sorry..."
msgstr "Scusa..."

msgctxt "1184_Komaki"
msgid "Well, I guess there's no use in getting fussy about it now. Here, and make sure to take it with you this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1256_Komaki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1304_Komaki"
msgid "Good. I've seen enough."

msgctxt "1340_Komaki"
msgid "All right. I'm going to tell you what I noticed while watching."

msgctxt "1400_Kiryu"
msgid "I see. Your powers of perception never fail to impress, Master Komaki. Your advice is right on the mark."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Komaki"
msgid "Well, I'm not in this business just for show."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Komaki"
msgid "So, tell me. Are your instincts returning to you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1436_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah. Thanks to your advice, I'm starting to remember how to move my body again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1448_Kiryu"
msgid "I feel like a new fighter now. Thank you, Master."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1472_Komaki"

msgctxt "1484_Komaki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1532_Komaki"

msgctxt "1544_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1556_Komaki"
msgid "All right. I'll be waiting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1580_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's practice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1592_Komaki"
msgid "All right. Get ready then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1664_Komaki"
msgid "Practice is simple. All you have to do is fight a round with one of my apprentices."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1676_Komaki"
msgid "I will then assess your performance and give you advice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1688_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1700_Komaki"
msgid "Well then, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1712_Komaki"
msgid "Fight!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1736_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's practice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1748_Komaki"
msgid "All right. Get ready then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1820_Komaki"
msgid "This session I will analyze your movements when using complex, stronger techniques."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1832_Komaki"
msgid "Your opponent is a tough one this time. Dish out as many special techniques as you like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1844_Komaki"
msgid "However, not using them will not disqualify you. I will observe your movements and give you advice just the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1856_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1868_Komaki"
msgid "Well then, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1880_Komaki"
msgid "Fight!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1904_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's practice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1916_Komaki"
msgid "All right. Get ready then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1988_Komaki"
msgid "Your opponent this time is a weapons specialist. Observe him and you will learn how to maneuver yourself efficiently in armed combat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2000_Komaki"
msgid "You may choose to use weapons or fight unarmed. I'll give you advice just the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2012_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2024_Komaki"
msgid "Well then, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2036_Komaki"
msgid "Fight!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2060_Komaki"
msgid "My favorite disciple has finally returned. It's been quite a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2072_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah. Looks like you're doing well as always."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2084_Komaki"
msgid "You left Kamurocho without saying goodbye. Again! I had to hear about the whole thing from someone else!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2096_Kiryu"
msgid "I apologize. It wasn't the best of times."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2108_Komaki"
msgid "Well, I am happy to see you safe. By the way, Kiryu, have you been keeping up with your training?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2120_Kiryu"
msgid "Well, I guess I haven't really been training as hard as I should recently..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2132_Komaki"
msgid "I thought so. You may be a master of the Komaki Martial Arts, but technique withers without daily practice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2144_Komaki"
msgid "Unbelievable... And you haven't even bothered to update your blog with all your revelations!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2156_Kiryu"
msgid "Wait, you read my blog!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2168_Komaki"
msgid "Of course I do! What kind of master would I be if I didn't know when my beloved disciple discovers new techniques!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2180_Kiryu"
msgid "I guess... But can you even use the Internet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2192_Komaki"
msgid "My apprentices kept bickering about how they could never get in touch with me. So I had to buy a cell phone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2204_Komaki"
msgid "I even used it to text you earlier."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2216_Kiryu"
msgid "You don't say... I assumed you had your apprentices do it for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2228_Komaki"
msgid "I am going out of my way to operate these unfamiliar devices, so the least you could do is update that blog of yours."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2240_Kiryu"
msgid "Okay, okay. I'll update it if I see anything else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2252_Komaki"
msgid "Good. I look forward to reading your blog."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2264_Komaki"
msgid "But enough about that. If you haven't been keeping up with your training, you should practice here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2276_Kiryu"
msgid "Practice?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2288_Komaki"
msgid "That's right. What you need most now is not new techniques, but strengthening your basics."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2300_Komaki"
msgid "I will revive that weakened, untrained body of yours by retraining you with the basics."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2312_Kiryu"
msgid "Basics are the foundation of everything, I guess."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2324_Komaki"
msgid "Precisely. If you would like to practice here, I'll give you a helping hand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2336_Komaki"
msgid "Tell me if you are interested."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2348_Kiryu"
msgid "I'll do that. I'll come back to you when I have time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2360_Komaki"
msgid "Good. I'll be waiting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2372_Kiryu"
msgid "(It seems like Master Komaki is looking forward to my blog. I better find some Revelations and update it.)"
