msgctxt "552_Minoru"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Saya"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Kiryu"
msgid "That's not all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Kiryu"
msgid "He tried to help an old lady recover her stolen purse, and even helped a guy look for his missing contact lenses."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Date"
msgid "Well, why didn't you say so?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Minoru"
msgid "I wanted to take responsibility for being late. Just like your father said, Saya, I should have made sure to be here on time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Date"

msgctxt "636_Date"

msgctxt "684_Saya"
msgid "Thanks, dad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Date"
msgid "But to be honest... I really don't like the idea of you two living together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Saya"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr "Cosa!?"

msgctxt "720_Minoru"
msgid "Um..."
msgstr "Ehm..."

msgctxt "732_Kiryu"
msgid "Why not?"
msgstr "Perché no?"

msgctxt "744_Date"
msgid "Saya, if you move out of the family house, who's going to look after her?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Saya"
msgid "...You mean mom?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Date"
msgid "That's right. I'm getting up there in years, but I'm doing all right by myself. Your mom, though..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Minoru"
msgid "In the 10+ years since we divorced, she's worked hard to put food on the table and take care of you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Minoru"
msgid "Don't you think she'll be lonely if you move out now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Saya"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Date"
msgid "I know everybody reaches a time when they drift away from their parents, and I know a father like me has no right to lecture you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Saya"
msgid "Dad..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Minoru"
msgid "So that's why you don't approve of Saya and me living together?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Date"
msgid "Yes."
msgstr "Sì."

msgctxt "864_Saya"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Kiryu"
msgid "Well, I don't see what the big deal is, Date-san."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Date"
msgid "Just whose daughter is this, Kiryu!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Kiryu"
msgid "I just mean the solution is simple. Why don't Saya and Minoru move in with Saya's mother?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Minoru"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr "Uh?"

msgctxt "924_Kiryu"
msgid "Then she wouldn't have to feel sad about losing her daughter. Am I wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Saya"
msgid "Actually... you might be right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Date"
msgid "Hold on a second. Before you go deciding things, don't you think you two should discuss how you feel?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Saya"
msgid "Right. I think it's a good idea. What about you, Minoru-san?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Minoru"
msgid "It seems like the best solution to me. I wouldn't want you to be worried about your mother."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Saya"
msgid "Minoru-san..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Kiryu"
msgid "Looks like a done deal, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008_Date"
msgid "Hmph. I don't know if I like you just deciding my daughter's whole life for her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1020_Saya"
msgid "Come on, dad! What kind of thing is that to say to Kiryu-san after all the help he's given us!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032_Date"
msgid "Yeah, yeah. Don't get all worked up over it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056_Minoru"
msgid "I will be. You can count on it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080_Date"
msgid "This is getting ridiculous. Do we have to wait all night for this kid to show up!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1092_Saya"
msgid "Where could Minoru-san be?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1104_Kiryu"
msgid "Hey, Date."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1116_Date"
msgid "Oh, Kiryu."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1128_Saya"
msgid "Kiryu-san..."
msgstr "Kiryu-san..."

msgctxt "1140_Kiryu"
msgid "I came by to see what was going on since you were taking so long. Saya's boyfriend hasn't shown up yet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1152_Date"
msgid "He has not! What is it with the young people these days? Being made to wait this long is disrespectful!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1164_Saya"
msgid "I can't get through to his cell phone. He's never ever been late before. I hope he hasn't been in some kind of accident..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1176_Date"
msgid "Hmph. Maybe he just didn't want to deal with me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1188_Saya"
msgid "Minoru-san's not like that! Something must've happened to him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1200_Date"
msgid "Eh, who knows."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1212_Kiryu"
msgid "We probably should take a look around the area. I'll go see if I can find him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1224_Saya"
msgid "I'll go, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1236_Kiryu"
msgid "Okay, let's split up and look for him. What's he look like?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1248_Saya"
msgid "Hm... Well, he's got a black cap and a gray pea coat he wears a lot. He's probably wearing them today, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1260_Saya"
msgid "He doesn't really have any features that stand out all that much, so he might be kind of hard to find."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1272_Kiryu"
msgid "Black cap and gray coat? That's something to go on, at least."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1284_Saya"
msgid "Dad, are you coming, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1296_Date"
msgid "I think I'd better head back to work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1308_Kiryu"
msgid "That's fine. If we find him, I'll give you a call. Then we can meet up here again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1320_Date"
msgid "Boy, this is really turning into an ordeal. Yeah, call me if he turns up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1332_Saya"
msgid "Sorry, dad. You too, Kiryu-san. I had no idea this was going to happen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1344_Kiryu"
msgid "Don't sweat it. I'll call you if I spot him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1356_Saya"
msgid "Thanks."
msgstr "Grazie."
