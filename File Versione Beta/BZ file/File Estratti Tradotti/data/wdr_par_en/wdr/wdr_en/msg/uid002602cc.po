msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1268_Miki"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1280_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1292_Akiyama"
msgid "When you go out to eat on a date, it's important to order\r\n"
"your date's favorite dish."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1304_Miki"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr "Davvero?"

msgctxt "1316_Akiyama"
msgid "When you see him at the club, get him to tell you his\r\n"
"favorite in advance. Make sure you remember what it is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1328_Akiyama"
msgid "Then, when you're on your date, try to order it in a very\r\n"
"matter-of-fact way: \"Oh, your favorite is such-and-such,\r\n"
"isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1340_Akiyama"
msgid "That will make him think, \"Gee, Miki bothered to remember my\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1352_Miki"
msgid "Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1364_Akiyama"
msgid "But the real key here is to add, \"I like that, too,\" while\r\n"
"you order."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1376_Miki"
msgid "Why's that?"
msgstr "Perché?"

msgctxt "1388_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, for one thing, when your date says she likes the same\r\n"
"food you do, it makes you happy. It also means you have\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1400_Miki"
msgid "Oh, I get it. But what if his favorite happens to be\r\n"
"something I absolutely hate?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Miki"
msgid "I can be a very picky person."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Akiyama"
msgid "You're a professional. Just grin and bear it."

msgctxt "1436_Miki"
msgid "Aw, do I have to? I guess I'll try..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1460_Master"
msgid "Here you go!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1508_Miki"
msgid "This looks amazing! Bon appétit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1520_Akiyama"
msgid "Not so fast! There's another technique that comes into play\r\n"
"when eating your meal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1532_Miki"
msgid "Is there really? Tell me about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1544_Akiyama"
msgid "(The thing to remember when eating is...)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1556_Akiyama"
msgid "When eating your meal on a date, you have to eat with\r\n"
"elegance and grace so as not to ruin your image as a\r\n"
"hostess."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1568_Miki"
msgid "Why's that?"
msgstr "Perché?"

msgctxt "1580_Akiyama"
msgid "The customer no doubt has a mental picture of the hostess he\r\n"
"likes. Ruin that image, and he's in for a rude awakening."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1592_Akiyama"
msgid "You're at your most vulnerable while eating, making meals\r\n"
"particularly dangerous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1604_Miki"
msgid "But if that's true, there's not much point in eating\r\n"
"together, is there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1616_Miki"
msgid "I mean, it doesn't exactly flow with what you said before\r\n"
"about projecting a sense of intimacy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1628_Akiyama"
msgid "You sure are sharp. I knew I could count on you to notice\r\n"
"that. Well done. No, the real key here is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1640_Akiyama"
msgid "When dining with a date, you have to maintain proper\r\n"
"etiquette while, at the same time, creating a domestic\r\n"
"atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1652_Miki"
msgid "Domestic? Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1664_Akiyama"
msgid "That's right. A hostess is typically seen as the polar\r\n"
"opposite of a domestic type."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1676_Akiyama"
msgid "So by projecting this homey aura, you accentuate the gap\r\n"
"between the two lifestyles."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1688_Akiyama"
msgid "A hostess who might seem a little distant at the club comes\r\n"
"across on a date as friendlier, more accessible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1700_Miki"
msgid "It's like you said before－you have to project a sense of\r\n"
"intimacy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1712_Akiyama"
msgid "Exactly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1724_Miki"
msgid "So how do I do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1736_Akiyama"
msgid "Let's see. If a dish uses seasonal ingredients, for example,\r\n"
"point that out to your date."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1748_Akiyama"
msgid "Or if a meal is nicely presented, say you'd like to try\r\n"
"making it yourself one day. Play up the fact that you can\r\n"
"cook."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1760_Akiyama"
msgid "You'd be hard-pressed to find a guy who doesn't love that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1772_Miki"
msgid "Hmm. Anything else?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1784_Akiyama"
msgid "When your date says something's tasty or what have you, say\r\n"
"something along the lines of, \"Oh, I'll keep that in mind.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1796_Miki"
msgid "It's almost like saying, \"I'll make that for you sometime,\"\r\n"
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1808_Akiyama"
msgid "Yep. It's just the promise of your cooking, though. You\r\n"
"don't actually have to go through with it. You only need to\r\n"
"hint at the possibility."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1820_Miki"
msgid "Right, right. This has been very educational."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1880_Akiyama"
msgid "Thanks for a great meal, Chef. We'll take the bill now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1892_Master"
msgid "Coming right up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1964_Akiyama"
msgid "Now, there's one more thing I'd like you to remember when it\r\n"
"comes to paying the bill."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1976_Miki"
msgid "Okay."
msgstr "Ok."

msgctxt "1988_Akiyama"
msgid "(The trick about paying the bill is...)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2000_Akiyama"
msgid "When you've been asked out on a date, you should go Dutch.\r\n"
"Each of you pays his or her share."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2012_Miki"
msgid "Are you serious!?"
msgstr "Dici sul serio!?"

msgctxt "2024_Akiyama"
msgid "I sure am. It shows your gratitude for your date's regular\r\n"
"visits to the club."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2036_Miki"
msgid "It might boost my image, but isn't it a little much\r\n"
"considering he's the one who asked me out?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2048_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2060_Miki"
msgid "Besides, I'd be afraid of hurting his pride..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2072_Akiyama"
msgid "Good call, Miki. That's one thing you never want to do, hurt\r\n"
"a customer's pride."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2084_Miki"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2096_Akiyama"
msgid "Instead..."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2132_Akiyama"
msgid "That's right. You're just pretending."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2144_Akiyama"
msgid "Seeing you prepared to pay like that transforms the evening\r\n"

"intimate meal."

msgctxt "2156_Akiyama"
msgid "Your date will feel an even closer bond between the two of\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2168_Miki"
msgid "Ah, I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2180_Akiyama"
msgid "Your date will insist you don't have to pay, of course, at\r\n"
"which point you thank him and put your wallet away."
msgstr ""

msgid "This way, you're both satisfied, and he keeps his pride\r\n"
