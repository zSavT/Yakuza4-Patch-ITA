msgstr ""

msgctxt "236_Ueda"
msgid "Yes, the surface of the soup was completely black. That was from the garlic oil."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "248_Matsuyama"
msgid "Right. Garlic oil is made by frying and browning garlic in oil to capture the garlic's aroma and flavor. It's what makes this ramen so black."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "260_Ueda"
msgid "Mmm, it gives the soup a fragrant aroma and slightly bittersweet flavor, adding depth to the rich No. 1 Star soup!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "272_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "But there's more to it than that. He used thicker noodles than we normally do to give it a special texture."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "284_Ueda"
msgid "Yeah, and all the garlic is sure to be good for your health, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "296_Kiryu"

msgctxt "416_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "Bravo! We were talking about you opening a new branch, or even starting your own place... But instead I'd like you to take over."

msgstr "Cosa!?"

msgctxt "440_Matsuyama"
msgid "What are you talking about!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "524_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Ueda"
msgid "It's true! I want to keep enjoying your ramen for a long time to come!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "Hmm... Still, I really do think Matsuyama here is ready for his own shop."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Ueda"
msgid "In that case, I have an idea. How about you act as partners?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Kiryu"
msgid "Partners?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Ueda"
msgid "Hear me out! Both of you could make your own kind of ramen, right here at No. 1 Star!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Kiryu"
msgid "That's a pretty interesting idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Matsuyama"
msgid "But that would be like we were competing with each other!\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "Exactly! That'll certainly make things interesting!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "Let's start right away! Starting today, we're partners!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "But don't think I'll go easy on you, just because you were my apprentice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Matsuyama"
msgid "Fine by me! I won't hold back, either!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Kiryu"
msgid "And, Ueda, I bet you're thinking about making an instant cup version of the new ramen already, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Ueda"
msgid "You know it! Ramen this good should be enjoyed by people everywhere!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Matsuyama"
msgid "An instant version might not be so easy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Ueda"
msgid "I can handle it! Give me one more bowl, in the name of research!"
