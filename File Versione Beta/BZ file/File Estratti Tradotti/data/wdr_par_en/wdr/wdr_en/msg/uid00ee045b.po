msgctxt "648_Tanimura"
msgid "No, it's not that. It's just kind of weird. Anyway, what's the bar's name?"

msgctxt "672_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "732_Naomi"
msgid "I assume you heard that from Saki. Blessed with the gift of gab, she is. Or should I say cursed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Naomi"
msgid "It was a detective by the name of Yusuke Kaga who was inquiring into your father and Bridge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Tanimura"
msgid "Kaga! So, that's what he meant by \"K\"..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Naomi"
msgid "Most likely."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Tanimura"
msgid "Yusuke Kaga... Well, that's one mystery solved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Tanimura"
msgid "Only thing is, the name \"K\" suddenly stops appearing in my father's memo book one day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Naomi"
msgid "Kaga was fired for mistakes made on the job."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Tanimura"
msgid "Fired?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Naomi"
msgid "After that, he opened a coffee shop. Foreign prostitutes were among his regular customers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Tanimura"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr "Davvero?"

msgctxt "888_Naomi"
msgid "He had looked after them while he was still a detective. Even after he was fired, they would still come to him seeking advice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Tanimura"
msgid "Does he still work at this shop?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Naomi"
msgid "He died... twenty-six years ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Tanimura"
msgid "The cause of death?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Naomi"
msgid "It was reported as accidental, but all the facts pointed toward murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Tanimura"
msgid "So basically, he was eliminated because he got too close to those foreign prostitutes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Naomi"
msgid "That matter is too cloudy for Naomi to see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Tanimura"
msgid "I don't believe a detective my father respected so much would make careless mistakes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Naomi"
msgid "He shot and killed an innocent bystander by accident during one of his cases."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Tanimura"
msgid "I seriously doubt that's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008_Naomi"
msgid "But why?"
msgstr "Ma perché?"

msgctxt "1020_Tanimura"
msgid "Because crack detectives like him know how to use a gun. I doubt he'd miss his mark like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032_Naomi"
msgid "Heh... You seem to be a fine detective yourself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1044_Naomi"
msgid "Your father said that Kaga had been set up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056_Tanimura"
msgid "By Bridge?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1068_Naomi"
msgid "That I cannot see, but during an investigation on illegal immigration, the trail led Kaga to a certain government official."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080_Tanimura"
msgid "A government official?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1092_Naomi"
msgid "A few of the undocumented workers arrested by Kaga had been issued suspicious-looking visas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1104_Naomi"
msgid "Many of them had been bought under the table."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1116_Tanimura"
msgid "Someone was selling visas?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1128_Naomi"
msgid "Foreigners need a work visa or student visa in order to work in Japan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1140_Naomi"
msgid "But the screening for such visas is very strict. Many foreigners end up buying them from corrupt officials for 400,000 or 500,000 yen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1152_Naomi"
msgid "Naomi has even heard of some who pay a million."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1164_Tanimura"
msgid "Why would anyone pay so much to come to Japan?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1176_Naomi"
msgid "Back then, we had a labor shortage. Employers never seemed to have enough workers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1188_Naomi"
msgid "But most of all, migrant workers saw Japan as the promised land, where jobs grew on trees."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1200_Tanimura"
msgid "So Kaga suspected that government official of receiving money for issuing illegal visas?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1212_Naomi"
msgid "Exactly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1224_Tanimura"
msgid "So who was this official?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1236_Naomi"
msgid "Naomi does not know for certain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1248_Naomi"
msgid "However, it may very well be Bridge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1260_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah."
msgstr "Sì."

msgctxt "1308_Tanimura"
msgid "Tanimura."
msgstr "Tanimura."

msgctxt "1320_Saki-chan"
msgid "It's me! I've got some info on that group!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1332_Tanimura"
msgid "You do!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1344_Saki-chan"
msgid "Let's meet somewhere away from prying eyes. How about the rooftop garden on top of Volcano?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1356_Tanimura"
msgid "I'll be there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1392_Naomi"
msgid "I take it that was Saki-chan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1404_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah."
msgstr "Sì."

msgctxt "1416_Naomi"
msgid "She was quite close to Kaga before he died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1428_Tanimura"
msgid "No kidding?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1440_Naomi"
msgid "You should talk to Saki-chan if you wish to learn more about Kaga."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1452_Tanimura"
msgid "Thank you."
msgstr "Grazie."

msgctxt "1488_Naomi"
msgid "I knew you would return."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1500_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh, Saki-chan's here, too, huh? Well, you might as well just tell me about Katsuura."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1512_Naomi"
msgid "The Asian Women's Friendship Association was merely a front for Katsuura."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1524_Tanimura"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1536_Naomi"
msgid "He was using it to connect with various Asian political figures and then profit handsomely from Japanese overseas development assistance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1548_Tanimura"
msgid "But aren't associations like that nonprofit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1560_Naomi"
msgid "He contracts out all work to companies run by relatives. There are fourteen of these companies in all, both big and small."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1572_Tanimura"
msgid "Hm... Doesn't anybody notice that it's at least a little bit suspicious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1584_Naomi"
msgid "A little hush money to police and politicians works wonders."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1596_Tanimura"
msgid "But that would take an awful lot of cash."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1608_Naomi"
msgid "That is where the foreign prostitutes come in. Katsuura is extorting money from them like there is no tomorrow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1620_Tanimura"
msgid "You have proof of this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1632_Naomi"
msgid "Finding proof is your job, Detective. But if Katsuura were the sex industry kingpin known as Bridge, it would all start to make sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1644_Tanimura"
msgid "So he's hiding behind a banner of compassion, while secretly exploiting immigrant women."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1656_Saki-chan"
msgid "The problem is, how do we get close to Katsuura?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1668_Tanimura"
msgid "I have an idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1680_Naomi"
msgid "Do tell."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1692_Tanimura"
msgid "I'll simply call the Association and tell them I'm coming to see Katsuura. Then－"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1704_Saki-chan"
msgid "You'll wait for a hitman to show up and try to stop you? Aren't you putting yourself at an unnecessary risk?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1716_Tanimura"
msgid "What choice do I have? I need some way to pick up his trail."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1728_Saki-chan"
msgid "Will you lure the hitman out around here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1740_Tanimura"
msgid "Too crowded. Their kind only strike when there are few people around. I'll head over to Pink Alley after I call."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1752_Saki-chan"
msgid "That's where the attack will take place?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1764_Tanimura"
msgid "Yup. Can I count on you for backup?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1776_Saki-chan"
msgid "Leave it to me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1800_Naomi"
msgid "Welcome. What can Naomi's amazing psychic powers do for you today? Wait, you're only here on a whim, aren't you? I can tell just by gazing upon you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1812_Naomi"
msgid "The Great Naomi does not provide her services to such foolhardy customers. My readings are not cheap, you see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1824_Naomi"
msgid "Try talking to the sad sack next to me. It might actually be worth your while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1848_Naomi"
msgid "Tell me, have you ever heard of Shellac? It's a small bar in the Champion District."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1860_Naomi"
msgid "A regular there by the name of Aoki has his finger on the pulse of the town. He seems to know what will happen before it actually does."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1872_Naomi"
msgid "Just between you and me, even I consult him from time to time. Why not go pay him a visit? Remember, it's Shellac in the Champion District."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1884_Naomi"
msgid "Are you trying to complete all of the substories? The sad sack on the left will give you a wonderful gift each time you complete one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1896_Naomi"
msgid "You will be notified by mail each time you complete something. Excited yet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1908_Naomi"
msgid "Until about a year ago, I told fortunes on the street under the name X Tiger. Unfortunately, I had only a few customers, as many thought I was \"creepy.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1920_Naomi"
msgid "I was trying too hard, what with pretending to be the silent mysterious type, specializing in crystal ball scrying and tarot cards."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1932_Naomi"
msgid "I cannot go into the details, but since money is no longer an issue, I set up shop here and opened up last summer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1944_Naomi"
msgid "The mood is much more mysterious here. The best things about this place are its cool summers and warm winters. I still don't get many customers, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1956_Naomi"
msgid "The sad sack next to me is my manservant. No, really, I kid you not."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1968_Naomi"
msgid "Apparently, he simply cannot get enough of me, but rest assured, he does take part in affairs that don't involve standing next to me and staring creepily."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1980_Player"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1992_Naomi"
msgid "Perhaps I should start acting more like a psychic..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2004_Naomi"
msgid "You see, people are always asking me things like, \"What should I do?\" Honestly, most of the time I just want to say, \"Just figure it out yourself.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2016_Naomi"
msgid "But, being a psychic and all, I have to give some sort of answer. So, I tell them to slow down and reexamine themselves. Understand what that means?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2028_Naomi"
msgid "Oh, I'll just tell you. What I mean is, check the Pause Menu sometimes. If you still don't know what I'm talking about, press the <Action:Button_Options@Adventure> button."
