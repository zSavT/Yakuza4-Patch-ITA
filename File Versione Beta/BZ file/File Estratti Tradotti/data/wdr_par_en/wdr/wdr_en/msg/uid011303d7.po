msgstr ""

msgctxt "2076_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2088_Saejima"

msgctxt "2160_Ochiai"
msgid "Huh. But if you don't win then you can't become champion, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2172_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2184_Saejima"
msgid "(Didn't get my point across... That didn't go well...)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2196_Saejima"
msgid "So, whaddya do on yer days off?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2208_Ochiai"
msgid "Well, let's see. Lately I've started watching anime. There's this one anime about a robot that I really like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2220_Saejima"
msgid "Anime, huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2232_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2256_Saejima"
msgid "(Looks like that put 'im in a foul mood... That didn't go well.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2268_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2280_Saejima"
msgid "They call it \"Japanimation\" or somethin', right? I heard about it from Sodachi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2292_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2304_Saejima"
msgid "(Er... That didn't go well...)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2316_Saejima"
msgid "Y'know, I was real into an anime about robots, too. Made me realize that even bad guys have their own purpose and sense o' justice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2328_Ochiai"
msgid "Wait, the anime you're talking about might actually be the same one that I like..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2340_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2352_Saejima"
msgid "(That was a good talk. I'm glad we came.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2364_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2376_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2388_Ochiai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2556_Ochiai"
msgid "I hate it when people just write off ideas like that! Who knows－it might be fun if you just tried. You have a really negative attitude."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2568_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2580_Ochiai"
