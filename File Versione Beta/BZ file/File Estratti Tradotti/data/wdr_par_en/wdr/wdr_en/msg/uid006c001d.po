msgctxt "9768_Akiyama"

msgctxt "9852_Rio"

msgctxt "9888_Rio"

msgctxt "9936_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm... Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9948_Akiyama"
msgid "What I'm trying to say is that people aren't going to point out your faults because they don't expect much based on the way you carry yourself. You'll have to figure them out by yourself."

msgctxt "10068_Rio"
msgid "I guess, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10080_Rio"
msgid "This is tricky."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10092_Akiyama"
msgid "That's too bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10128_Rio"

msgctxt "10152_Rio"
msgid "Hmm. Can I even notice something like that on my own?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10164_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "10188_Akiyama"

msgctxt "10200_Rio"

msgctxt "10392_Akiyama"

msgctxt "12720_Akiyama"

msgctxt "12852_Akiyama"

msgctxt "13116_Rio"
msgid "Whenever a guy does something wrong, I wanna scream, \"What's wrong with you!?\""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "13176_Akiyama"
