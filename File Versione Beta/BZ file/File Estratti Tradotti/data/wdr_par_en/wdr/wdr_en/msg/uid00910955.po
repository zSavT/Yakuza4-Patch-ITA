msgctxt "108_Kiryu"

msgctxt "132_Kiryu"

msgctxt "168_Rouge"

msgctxt "180_Kiryu"
msgid "I've got enough people after me in Kamurocho already. I'm not interested in going head to head with any more groups, gangs, or syndicates."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "192_Rouge"
msgid "Hahaha. In other words, discretion is the better part of valor? So that's also a part of being the Legendary Yakuza..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "204_Rouge"
msgid "However, if that's why you want to know, I'm afraid I can't give you an answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "216_Rouge"
msgid "It would give you an unfair advantage the next time we make an attempt on your life."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "228_Rouge"
msgid "Now then, if you'll excuse me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "300_Akaishi"
msgid "Interesting..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "312_Akaishi"
msgid "So, you beat them this time, but they may come looking for you again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "324_Akaishi"
msgid "Is that really what you wanted, Kiryu-san?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "336_Kiryu"
msgid "I don't think we'll need to deal with them again anytime soon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "348_Kiryu"
msgid "I'll probably be back in Okinawa the next time they try to take me down, so I'm not going to worry about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "360_Akaishi"
msgid "Hmm, interesting. So, it's not necessary to wipe them out completely? Is this some kind of \"live and let live\" philosophy of the underworld?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "372_Kiryu"
msgid "Well, wading through all those gang conflicts, I got the sense that all groups are capable of making a change for the better."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "384_Kiryu"
msgid "It's not impossible, you know. Even for a group that sets out to crush the yakuza, but ends up a lot like the yakuza themselves."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "396_Kiryu"
msgid "As long as they keep coming after me, I'll keep standing my ground."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "408_Kiryu"
msgid "There've been plenty of guys who picked a fight with me only to come out of it a better man."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "420_Akaishi"
msgid "I see what you mean. You know, you really do live up to the title of fourth chairman. You're a better man than I'll ever be."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "432_Kiryu"
msgid "Huh? You already knew about me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "444_Akaishi"
msgid "Haha, doesn't everybody know about you? You're famous. Or infamous, depending on whom you ask."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Akaishi"
msgid "Anyone in this town who hasn't heard of Kazuma Kiryu must have been living under a rock!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "468_Akaishi"
msgid "Oh, I almost forgot to tell you! The gang violence seems to have died down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_Akaishi"
msgid "Apparently, the mafia has been putting a lot of pressure on the gangs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Kiryu"
msgid "The mafia?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Akaishi"
msgid "That's right. From the mafia's point of view, there's not much to gain from stirring up any more trouble."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "516_Kiryu"
msgid "Guess that's how it goes. Yakuza, mafia... No shortage of thugs out there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "528_Akaishi"
msgid "So it would seem. Thanks for your hard work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Akaishi"
msgid "I'm sure there are a few stragglers out there who haven't had their fill of violence yet, so please don't let your guard down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "552_Akaishi"
msgid "Also, this is our final gift to you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Akaishi"
msgid "I'll be waiting in front of the theater, as always. If you get any proof of driving more gang members out of town, bring it to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Kiryu"
msgid "So I get to meet you at last. You're the boss of the Dark Clan?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Man"
msgid "Yes, at the moment. I'm known as Rouge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Kiryu"
msgid "At the moment? What the hell does that mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "684_Rouge"
msgid "When the Dark Clan of Yakuza Extermination takes on a job, the person executing the hit takes control."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Rouge"
msgid "This \"boss\" is given complete authority until the hit is executed, or he perishes. Those are the rules under which we operate."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Rouge"
msgid "So, in short, I'm the current Dark Clan leader for the matter at hand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "720_Kiryu"
msgid "I see. Just what kind of members belong to this little syndicate of yours?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "732_Rouge"
msgid "Well, you could say it's mostly those not too fond of the yakuza, but the majority are foreigners."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "744_Kiryu"
msgid "A foreign mafia?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Rouge"
msgid "Not all of them. Some simply have reason to bear a grudge against yakuza. But many are mafia members from all across Asia."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Kiryu"
msgid "I see. But then, why are you all trying to eliminate me? I'm no longer with the yakuza."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Rouge"
msgid "Since either you or I must die to end this, I suppose we might as well talk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Rouge"
msgid "Your mere presence threatens to disrupt the delicate balance within the underworld. We've been well aware of that for some time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Rouge"
msgid "Controlling you to make the yakuza move as we see fit would be the optimal scenario."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Rouge"
msgid "But as that doesn't seem to be possible, the decision was made to eliminate you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Kiryu"
msgid "Why did you just decide this now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Rouge"
msgid "The death of Lau Ka Long of the Snake Flower Triad was the main reason."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Rouge"
msgid "Until then, we'd simply regarded you with caution. But Lau's death came as a huge shock to us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Rouge"
msgid "Of course, we're aware it wasn't you who killed him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Rouge"
msgid "However, his death changed the balance of power among the Asian mafia here in Kamurocho."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Rouge"
msgid "Not only are you yakuza, you shattered the power balance in Kamurocho with one fell swoop."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Rouge"
msgid "For those like us who try to control the city from the shadows, it was quite unsettling."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Rouge"
msgid "You probably can't even imagine how threatened we felt at the prospect of you wiping out everything we struggled to accomplish."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Rouge"
msgid "It is true you're not pulling the strings in the underworld anymore. You've settled down in Okinawa."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Rouge"
msgid "But you're like a natural disaster that takes the city by storm every so often."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Kiryu"
msgid "So why go to the trouble of getting involved in that mess with the gangs?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Rouge"
msgid "Just when we were trying to figure out what to do, a rather strange war broke out between the gangs vying for your head."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Rouge"
msgid "Normally, we'd ignore such juvenile antics. However, we just couldn't bear to let a golden opportunity go to waste."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Kiryu"
msgid "Okay, now that I know the why, let me ask you one more thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008_Rouge"
msgid "Hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1020_Kiryu"
msgid "Aren't you guys just a bunch of criminals, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032_Rouge"
msgid "What do you mean by that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1044_Kiryu"
msgid "You can make a big deal about yakuza and call me a disaster or whatever, but in the end you're just the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056_Kiryu"
msgid "The same goes with you targeting me. You can go on about your high and mighty cause, but it all comes down to a simple power struggle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1068_Kiryu"
msgid "So cut the crap, and bring it on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080_Rouge"
msgid "Well, now that it's all out in the open, it's time for me to eliminate Kazuma Kiryu, the man who dares to challenge our mighty syndicate!"
msgstr ""
