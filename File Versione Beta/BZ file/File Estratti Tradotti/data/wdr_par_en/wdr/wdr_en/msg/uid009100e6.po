msgctxt "1892_Master"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1964_Saejima"
msgid "How ya supposed to go about doin' that? Write a book or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1976_Master"
msgid "Guess I could start by talkin' to a few of the homeless fellas in the vicinity. Gotta start somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1988_Saejima"
msgid "Ain't that a bit too low-key?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2000_Master"
msgid "I think about it the same as this here hole. I only got this far 'cause I made that first swing with my pickaxe."

msgctxt "2012_Master"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2024_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2036_Master"
msgid "Plus we're gonna have to dig up this treasure of my father's anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2048_Saejima"
msgid "Haha. Think about it for a second, old man. What rich idiot digs up his own treasure?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2060_Saejima"
msgid "Ya got more money than you'll ever need. Why not just hire some people or use machines to dig?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2072_Master"
msgid "Hahaha! You got a point there!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2084_Master"
msgid "Saejima... Thanks for all of your help."

msgctxt "2096_Master"
msgid "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to make it this far."

msgctxt "2108_Master"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2120_Saejima"
msgid "Ya know damn well I can't accept that. That's all ya got to remember yer old man by."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2144_Master"
msgid "My father had a lot of regrets in these here memoirs. But I'm gonna put 'em to rest once and for all. The sword though, I want you to have."

msgctxt "2156_Saejima"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2168_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2192_Master"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2288_Saejima"
msgid "So what's next for ya, old man?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2300_Master"
msgid "Them books on fightin' techniques we uncovered had to be my father's."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2312_Master"
msgid "I'm sure there are more, so I'll keep on diggin' for now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2324_Saejima"

msgctxt "2336_Master"

msgctxt "2348_Saejima"
msgid "Yep."
msgstr "Sì."

msgctxt "2360_Master"
msgid "Oh yeah. I found this book under that rock just a bit ago. You should take it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2384_Master"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2408_Saejima"
msgid "Whew... That was some damn good exercise."

msgctxt "2420_Master"
msgid "Thanks for the extra hand. Found this under one of the rocks－I won't be needing it, so you take it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2456_Master"
msgid "Come back whenever you can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2492_Saejima"
msgid "Is this Air Raid Shelter No. 2?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2504_Master"
msgid "Looks like it. And if that's the case, then we're close to our goal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2516_Saejima"
msgid "The time's finally come for all those hard years of work to pay off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2528_Master"
msgid "I suppose..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2540_Saejima"
msgid "So where do we start diggin', then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2552_Master"
msgid "My father said there was a marker to go by..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2564_Saejima"
msgid "Let's look around, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2624_Saejima"
msgid "This must be it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2636_Master"
msgid "Yeah, no doubt about it. A rock this big's got no business bein' here. Unless someone put it here on purpose, I mean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2648_Saejima"
msgid "Ain't this too big for a pickaxe though?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2660_Master"
msgid "I reckon so. Hm? Wait a second..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2684_Master"
msgid "There's a decent sized crack in the rock. If we jam some kinda explosive in there, I bet ya we could blow this baby to kingdom come."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2696_Saejima"
msgid "Do you have some?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2708_Master"
msgid "Of course... not! But you know, I was actually kinda thinkin'..."

msgctxt "2720_Saejima"
msgid "That I'd get it, right? Okay, okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2732_Master"
msgid "I remember Ken-chan sayin' he used to work as a pyrotechnic. He might know how to go about makin' somethin' we could use."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2744_Saejima"
msgid "Ken-chan? The guy that almost wet his pants when those punks rushed ya, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2756_Saejima"
msgid "Well, alright. I'll go ask him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2768_Master"
msgid "Hmm? Look, another book."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2780_Saejima"
msgid "Is that thing yer old man mentioned a book too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2792_Master"

msgctxt "2828_Master"
msgid "Come back whenever you can help. I'll go ahead and show you back to the entrance."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3044_Master"
msgid "We're just gonna hafta dig it over again. No matter, happens all the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3056_Master"
msgid "I reckon we right slipped up. Come back whenever you can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3080_Master"
msgid "All right! We broke through the rock!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3092_Saejima"
msgid "That's the way, old man! Look, the path keeps going!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3104_Punk-like Man"
msgid "Son of a bitch. How'd we lose with our numbers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3116_Saejima"
msgid "Ya can't win if all yer doin' is thinkin' about the numbers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3128_Saejima"
msgid "Get the hell outta here, an' leave the poor old man alone. Let him live out his dream, ya punks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3140_Punk-like Man"
msgid "We'll stop here for today, but you better believe we'll be back for our money!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3200_Master"
msgid "Who the hell came up with that conflabbed rumor about there bein' money down here anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3212_Saejima"
msgid "Well, I mean it does kinda have that buried treasure look, don't ya think? ...Huh? Look, another book."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3224_Master"
msgid "Another fighting manual?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3236_Saejima"
msgid "Looks like it. Just like the others, this one's filled with different practical techniques."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3248_Master"
msgid "Findin' this many books gets me thinkin' we might just stumble across the actual person that buried all of 'em."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3260_Saejima"
msgid "Yer old man a collector of these kinds of books?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3272_Master"
msgid "No, my father was a born n' bred soldier. A fearless man who proudly fought for his country."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3284_Saejima"
msgid "I see... Then I guess these books wouldn't belong to him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3296_Saejima"
msgid "In either case, I can't afford to pass these up. Hope ya don't mind if I take 'em."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3320_Master"
msgid "Let's start digging the next pathway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3332_Master"
msgid "Come back whenever you can. I'll see you to the entrance."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3512_Saejima"
msgid "Hmm? A dead end."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3524_Master"
msgid "Hmm. Guess this ain't the place..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3536_Saejima"
msgid "So, you sayin' it was wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3548_Master"
msgid "When ya think about it, that sign was lyin' on the ground. I bet it used to be somewhere else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3560_Saejima"
msgid "I get it. So we gotta look for the place it used to be originally."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3572_Master"
msgid "Bingo. Hold on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3584_Master"
msgid "Hey, Saejima. Look, another book."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3596_Saejima"
msgid "Another one? Let's see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3608_Saejima"
msgid "This one's about martial arts too. This technique'll come in handy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3620_Master"
msgid "Two in a row. That's funny. Could be some sorta clue."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3632_Saejima"
msgid "If we find more, it might mean there's some kinda link to that thing yer old man left behind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3644_Master"
msgid "Yeah, I reckon... Wait a second!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3668_Master"
msgid "Could that hole be－"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3740_Master"
msgid "I knew it. The sign was set there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3752_Saejima"
msgid "So breakin' this rock'll open up the path to Air Raid Shelter No. 2, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3764_Master"
msgid "Then it's settled－we try diggin' here next. Oh, when you got the time, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3776_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3800_Master"

msgctxt "3920_Saejima"
msgid "What is it? It's so big."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3932_Master"
msgid "I think it's an air raid shelter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3944_Saejima"
msgid "Air raid shelter?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3956_Master"
msgid "Yeah. Used during the war I reckon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3968_Master"
msgid "I'm sure it's got a good deal of historical value too, bein' in such good shape and all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3980_Saejima"
