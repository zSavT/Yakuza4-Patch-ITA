msgctxt "4260_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4476_Chihiro"
msgid "Why do you say that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4488_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, if you're popular, you could make that much fairly quickly. But if not, it could take a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4500_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4512_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4524_Chihiro"

msgctxt "4644_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4668_Chihiro"
msgid "Oh? Well, thanks for the compliment, but I think you're just being nice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4680_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4692_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4704_Tanimura"

msgctxt "4728_Tanimura"

msgctxt "4752_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4764_Chihiro"
msgid "Gambling? You mean slots and pachinko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4776_Tanimura"
msgid "I'm more of a mahjong or horse racing fan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4788_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4800_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4812_Tanimura"
msgid "Why didn't you join a normal theater club?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4824_Chihiro"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4836_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, you want to be an actress in movies, not in kabuki, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4848_Chihiro"
msgid "That's true... Come to think of it, women don't usually act in kabuki, do they?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4860_Tanimura"
msgid "Right. It might be a better experience to do normal theater."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4872_Chihiro"
msgid "But every actor does normal theater. Wouldn't kabuki be better because it's so different?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4884_Tanimura"
msgid "Huh. I hadn't thought of that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4896_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, I'm going to make the best of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4908_Chihiro"
msgid "This might be a bit awkward, but why do you go to hostess clubs?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4920_Tanimura"
msgid "That's a tough one... I guess it's for the stress relief. Drinking and talking with pretty girls helps me wind down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4932_Chihiro"
msgid "Ah, I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4944_Chihiro"
msgid "Then what do you think is the best way to become a popular hostess?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4956_Tanimura"
msgid "That's a toughie, too. Well, the job of a hostess is to be the ideal woman. From their customer's point of view, at least."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4968_Chihiro"
msgid "I have to be... ideal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4980_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, whatever they might think that is. Pretty, considerate, a good conversationalist. Things like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4992_Tanimura"
msgid "Hey, you want to be an actress, right? You could try to play the part of the ideal woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5004_Chihiro"
msgid "Maybe. I'm still not sure I understand, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5016_Chihiro"
msgid "I know! It could help if you tell me what your ideal woman is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5028_Tanimura"
msgid "A pure and innocent woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5040_Chihiro"
msgid "Huh? That's your type?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5052_Tanimura"
msgid "If I had to choose."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5064_Chihiro"
msgid "But that sounds like me. I mean, it's odd to say that myself, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5076_Chihiro"
msgid "Are you saying I'm your ideal woman?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5088_Tanimura"
msgid "Maybe..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5100_Chihiro"
msgid "Really!? Wow!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5112_Tanimura"
msgid "A strong-willed woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5124_Chihiro"
msgid "You mean a tough girl?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5136_Chihiro"
msgid "\"Down that drink right now, you lowly worm!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5148_Chihiro"
msgid "That kind of thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5160_Tanimura"
msgid "Um, that's not quite what I had in mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5172_Chihiro"
msgid "Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5184_Chihiro"
msgid "\"Drink that before I smack you!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5196_Chihiro"
msgid "How about that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5208_Tanimura"
msgid "No, that's not it either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5220_Chihiro"
msgid "I don't get it. This is hard..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5232_Tanimura"
msgid "Give up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5244_Chihiro"
msgid "No! I just have to research strong-willed women some more. I'll be ready next time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5256_Tanimura"
msgid "Haha. That's one way to go about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5268_Tanimura"
msgid "A ditzy woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5280_Chihiro"
msgid "Like those celebrities on TV?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5292_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, I guess that could work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5304_Chihiro"
msgid "Okay, then. I'll try to be ditzy next time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5316_Tanimura"
msgid "Hmm. If you have to try, it probably won't work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5328_Chihiro"
msgid "It won't? But I'll make sure you don't notice that I'm acting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5340_Tanimura"
msgid "But you just told me you're gonna be acting. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5352_Chihiro"
msgid "Wha...? Oh no, what should I do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5364_Tanimura"
msgid "Heh, you might be ditzy enough as it is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5376_Chihiro"
msgid "I'm twenty years old, and I've only had three boyfriends."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5388_Tanimura"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr "Davvero?"

msgctxt "5400_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah. It's pretty unusual to have only had three boyfriends by my age, don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5412_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh, I don't know. The number isn't all that important."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5424_Tanimura"
msgid "It's the relationships themselves that really matter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5436_Chihiro"
msgid "You're probably right. What were you like when you were twenty?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5448_Tanimura"
msgid "When I was twenty?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5460_Tanimura"
msgid "All I thought about was girls."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5472_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5484_Tanimura"
msgid "I certainly thought so at the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5496_Chihiro"
msgid "Hmm... Maybe I should be on my guard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5508_Tanimura"
msgid "What's that supposed to mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5520_Chihiro"
msgid "Who knows what might happen to an innocent girl like me, with an experienced man like you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5532_Tanimura"
msgid "Now just a minute! Who are you calling experienced?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5544_Chihiro"
msgid "Hehe. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5556_Tanimura"
msgid "I wasn't interested in love yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5568_Chihiro"
msgid "Huh. I would've thought you'd have plenty of girlfriends by then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5580_Tanimura"
msgid "I didn't have time for it. I've had a pretty rough life."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5592_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5604_Tanimura"
msgid "What makes you say that?"

msgctxt "5616_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5652_Tanimura"

msgid "Horses? What do you mean by that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5676_Tanimura"
msgid "Racehorses."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5688_Tanimura"
msgid "There are a lot of things you can do when you're twenty. The races, pachinko, mahjong..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5700_Chihiro"
msgid "You gamble?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5712_Tanimura"
msgid "Hm? A bit. Just for fun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5724_Chihiro"
msgid "You sure? You're not in a lot of debt, are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5736_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5748_Chihiro"
msgid "Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5760_Chihiro"
msgid "What kind of work do you do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5772_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5784_Chihiro"
msgid "Ah. That explains it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5796_Tanimura"
msgid "Explains what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5808_Chihiro"
msgid "Why you've got such an impressive body. Broad shoulders, strong chest..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5820_Tanimura"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr "Davvero?"

msgctxt "5832_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah. Actually, I like muscular guys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5844_Tanimura"
msgid "Is that so? Have you always been like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5856_Chihiro"
msgid "Yes. My father used to lift weights, so I notice muscles right away."

msgctxt "5868_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5964_Tanimura"

msgctxt "5976_Tanimura"

msgctxt "6948_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6960_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6972_Tanimura"
msgid "That's definitely economical."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6984_Chihiro"

msgctxt "7008_Chihiro"

msgctxt "7020_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7032_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7044_Chihiro"
msgid "Really? This may be the first time I've been complimented for my appetite."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7056_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7068_Chihiro"
msgid "Oh no, I'd be too embarrassed to do something like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7080_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7092_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7104_Tanimura"
msgid "Sure. I think..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7116_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7128_Chihiro"
msgid "Um. No, not recently."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7140_Tanimura"
msgid "And do you chew your food properly? Thorough chewing leads to better digestion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7152_Chihiro"
msgid "Really? I guess I don't chew my food that much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7164_Tanimura"
msgid "Also, if you take longer to eat, you won't feel the need to have as much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7176_Chihiro"
msgid "Wow. You're full of good advice, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7188_Tanimura"

msgctxt "7200_Chihiro"
msgid "I know. I need to make sure I've got a well-balanced diet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7212_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7224_Chihiro"
msgid "Let's see. Cake, cookies, pies..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7236_Tanimura"
msgid "Whoa, hold on a sec. Do you only make sweets? That can't be good for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7248_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7260_Tanimura"

msgctxt "7284_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7332_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7344_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7356_Tanimura"
msgid "Strange? How?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7368_Chihiro"
msgid "He's listless and doesn't have much of an appetite. I'm worried about him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7380_Tanimura"
msgid "Maybe he's lonely. He probably wants more attention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7392_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah, I haven't been able to play with him much since I started working here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7404_Tanimura"
msgid "That's probably it. Rabbits are social creatures. You need to play with him more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7416_Chihiro"
msgid "Yes, you're right. I'd better make some time just for me and Chachamaru!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7428_Chihiro"
msgid "I'll let you know if he gets better."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7440_Tanimura"
msgid "All right."
msgstr "Va bene."

msgctxt "7452_Tanimura"
msgid "Maybe he wants to go outside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7464_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah... Spending most of his time in a little cage must be pretty boring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7476_Tanimura"
msgid "You could take him to a park and play with him there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7488_Chihiro"
msgid "That's not a bad idea. I'll do that on my next day off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7500_Tanimura"
msgid "Can I come too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7512_Chihiro"
msgid "Nope! This is my date with Chachamaru. You'd just be a third wheel."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7524_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7536_Tanimura"
msgid "It's not worth getting upset over. I'm sure he'll get better eventually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7548_Chihiro"
msgid "How do you know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7560_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, the same thing happens to people. His  appetite will be back to normal in a few days."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7572_Chihiro"
msgid "But people and animals aren't the same! If I do nothing, he might get worse!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7584_Tanimura"
msgid "Then just take him to a vet. It's no big deal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7596_Chihiro"
msgid "You really don't care, do you? I think I'll talk about it to someone else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7608_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7620_Chihiro"

msgctxt "7644_Chihiro"

msgctxt "7656_Tanimura"

msgctxt "7668_Chihiro"
msgid "Ready? Watch my eyebrows! First the right one..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7680_Chihiro"
msgid "Twitch!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7692_Chihiro"
msgid "And now the left..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7704_Chihiro"
msgid "Twitch!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7716_Tanimura"
msgid "You can move your eyebrows independently?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7728_Chihiro"
msgid "What do you think?"
msgstr "Cosa ne pensa?"

msgctxt "7740_Tanimura"
msgid "That takes coordination. I certainly couldn't do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7752_Chihiro"
msgid "Hehe! You know, you should try it! You might have my special talent too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7764_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7776_Chihiro"
msgid "What? Oh, come on! Be a man! I mean, I did it, didn't I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7788_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7800_Chihiro"
msgid "Okay, it'll be your homework! You have to learn to do it by the time I see you next!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7812_Tanimura"
msgid "Are you serious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7824_Tanimura"
msgid "That's your special talent?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7836_Chihiro"
msgid "Isn't it great? I practiced for a while!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7848_Tanimura"
msgid "Er... It's a little underwhelming."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7860_Chihiro"
msgid "Oh... Well, at least you're honest."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7872_Tanimura"
msgid "But it's just my personal opinion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7884_Chihiro"
msgid "No, I get it. I won't show off my special talents anymore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7896_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7908_Tanimura"
msgid "I'd give it a four out of ten."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7920_Chihiro"
msgid "Huh? Isn't that pretty low?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7932_Chihiro"
msgid "I hoped to get at least a six."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7944_Tanimura"
msgid "A six? Sounds like you aren't impressed with your talent, either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7956_Chihiro"
msgid "That's not true! I'm pleased with it, and you should be too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7968_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7980_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7992_Tanimura"

msgctxt "8040_Tanimura"
msgid "Not if you don't want to tell me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8052_Chihiro"
msgid "No, it's okay! I do want to tell you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8064_Chihiro"
msgid "I... I went to an audition the other day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8076_Tanimura"
msgid "Like for a commercial?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8088_Chihiro"
msgid "No. It was for a supporting role in a late-night soap opera."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8100_Chihiro"
msgid "One of my friends in my theater group said I should try out. So I went, and I thought I did pretty well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8112_Tanimura"
msgid "Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8124_Chihiro"
msgid "I thought maybe, just maybe, I might get cast. But they never got back to me about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8136_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8148_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8160_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, at least it was a good experience."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8172_Chihiro"
msgid "Not getting cast was a good experience?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8184_Tanimura"
msgid "Sure. Even veteran actors don't get cast sometimes."

msgctxt "8196_Tanimura"
msgid "If you're not right for the part, it doesn't matter how good you are."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8208_Chihiro"
msgid "I guess that's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8220_Tanimura"
msgid "But if you keep trying, you'll find the perfect part for you. Just give it time."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8280_Chihiro"
msgid "It was my first real failure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8292_Tanimura"
msgid "And it won't be your last. You can't let it get to you."

msgctxt "8316_Chihiro"
msgid "All right! I'll try to stay positive!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8352_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8364_Chihiro"
msgid "What? I don't think I'm ready for that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8376_Tanimura"
msgid "That's your problem right there. Your attitude's all wrong. You have to aim higher."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8388_Tanimura"
msgid "Or do you want to be a supporting actor forever?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8400_Chihiro"
msgid "No... I do want to play the lead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8412_Tanimura"
msgid "Then you can't let a little setback like this get you down."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8496_Tanimura"

msgctxt "8520_Chihiro"

msgctxt "8544_Chihiro"

msgctxt "8556_Tanimura"

msgctxt "8568_Tanimura"

msgctxt "8592_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8604_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "9996_Tanimura"

msgctxt "10152_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "10164_Chihiro"

msgctxt "10176_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "10476_Tanimura"

msgctxt "10488_Chihiro"

msgctxt "10572_Tanimura"

msgctxt "11064_Tanimura"

msgctxt "11088_Tanimura"
msgid "I mean, doesn't the term railroad just refer to the train tracks?"

msgctxt "13896_Chihiro"

msgctxt "13908_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, it's just that, uh... At the right time, I want to introduce myself formally."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "13932_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "13944_Chihiro"

msgctxt "14040_Tanimura"

msgctxt "14136_Chihiro"

msgctxt "14148_Chihiro"
msgid "I won't force you if you don't want to."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14160_Tanimura"

msgctxt "14184_Tanimura"

msgctxt "14196_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, yeah, but we can't meet in person if it's the middle of the night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14208_Tanimura"
msgid "But it can be hard to tell what the other person is really thinking over the phone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14220_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14232_Chihiro"

msgctxt "14280_Tanimura"
msgid "It depends on when it is. I'm not always available to talk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14292_Chihiro"
msgid "Ah, okay. I guess a police officer can't drop everything to chat, huh? Not with the stakeouts and investigations and such."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14304_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14316_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14388_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh? That sounds fun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14400_Chihiro"
msgid "I guess. She scolded me when I got up in the morning and ate a piece of cake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14412_Chihiro"
msgid "She was shocked that I was eating it first thing in the morning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14424_Chihiro"
msgid "Is that such an unusual thing to do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14436_Tanimura"
msgid "I don't do it, that's for sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14448_Chihiro"
msgid "But I bought that cake to eat for breakfast. It gives me energy to start the day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14460_Chihiro"
msgid "Is that so strange?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14472_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, that's pretty strange. What kind of person has cake for breakfast?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14484_Chihiro"
msgid "I don't know. Everybody in my family did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14496_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14508_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, if you like it, I guess it's okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14520_Chihiro"
msgid "All right! There's nothing better than cake in the morning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14532_Chihiro"
msgid "You should try it sometime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14544_Tanimura"
msgid "I don't like sweets much."

msgctxt "14556_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14568_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14580_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14592_Chihiro"
msgid "How about you? What do you have for breakfast?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14604_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh, it varies. My friend runs a Chinese restaurant, so I often stop by there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14616_Chihiro"
msgid "You eat out even for breakfast? You should try to cook at least one meal a day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14628_Tanimura"
msgid "Says the girl who eats cake for breakfast."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14640_Chihiro"
msgid "Haha! You got me there!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14652_Tanimura"
msgid "You should have rice for breakfast. Eating cake in the morning is just wrong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14664_Chihiro"
msgid "Wrong? Isn't that going a little far? People are free to eat whatever they want for breakfast."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14676_Tanimura"
msgid "But it doesn't seem like breakfast if the person next to you is having cake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14688_Chihiro"
msgid "Then maybe you could have cake, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14700_Chihiro"
msgid "Oh, forget it! I'll never have breakfast with you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14712_Tanimura"
msgid "People can fight about whether to have bread or rice for breakfast, but cake?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14724_Chihiro"
msgid "Hehe. It is kind of funny, isn't it? I'm kinda enjoying this. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14736_Tanimura"
msgid "I still say it should be rice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14748_Chihiro"

msgctxt "14760_Chihiro"

msgctxt "14772_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14784_Tanimura"
msgid "That's kinda sudden."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14796_Chihiro"
msgid "My clothes have been fitting a little tight around the tummy. I've decided to watch what I eat and exercise!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14808_Chihiro"
msgid "I plan to lose five kilos! And I'll need your support!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14820_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "14832_Chihiro"
msgid "Don't worry. I'm pretty healthy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14844_Tanimura"
msgid "Well, okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14856_Chihiro"
msgid "I'll jog every morning before school. I want to do this the right way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14868_Tanimura"
msgid "You shouldn't exercise without eating. Make sure you get a big breakfast beforehand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14880_Chihiro"
msgid "Huh? How can I diet if I'm eating big meals?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14892_Tanimura"
msgid "I don't know. I'm just worried about your health. You shouldn't push yourself too hard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14904_Chihiro"
msgid "Hehe. Thanks for worrying about me. All right, I'll eat something before I jog."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14916_Chihiro"
msgid "I'll be slim before you know it. Just wait and see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14928_Tanimura"
msgid "All right."
msgstr "Va bene."

msgctxt "14940_Tanimura"
msgid "I'll be glad to help. What do you need me to do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14952_Chihiro"
msgid "Come running with me every morning! You can be my coach!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14964_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh. I don't know about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14976_Chihiro"
msgid "Hey! You said you'd help!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "14988_Tanimura"
msgid "Yeah, but I run quite a bit on the job. I don't like the idea of going out of my way to do it some more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15000_Chihiro"
msgid "But I can't keep it up by myself!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15012_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15024_Tanimura"
msgid "I'm sorry. I'll find some other way to help."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15036_Chihiro"
msgid "Hmph. I guess you didn't mean it when you said you'd help me. I don't feel like dieting anymore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15048_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15060_Tanimura"
msgid "Most diets fail right away, you know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15072_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, mine won't! I know I can do it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15084_Tanimura"
msgid "But can you really stop yourself from eating what you want? Even if you manage to exercise, it's the diet that's going to be tough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15096_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, you'll just have to watch me and make sure I don't slip up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15108_Tanimura"
msgid "Okay. Step one: cut out the cake. Step two: stop going to the convenience store."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15120_Chihiro"
msgid "What!? That's not fair! What'll I have to look forward to?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15132_Tanimura"
msgid "I told you. This is why diets fail. Are you going to quit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15144_Chihiro"
msgid "Ugh... No, I can do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15156_Chihiro"
msgid "Have you ever read \"The Tale of Genji\"?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15168_Tanimura"
msgid "Bits and pieces. It's been a while."

msgctxt "15180_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15192_Tanimura"
msgid "A masterpiece? What's so good about it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15204_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, for one thing, Prince Genji is a total playboy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15216_Chihiro"
msgid "He courts tons of beautiful women. That whole time period is so romantic!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15228_Tanimura"
msgid "I think you've got it wrong. As I recall, Prince Genji had a lot of affairs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15240_Chihiro"
msgid "Well, yes, that's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15252_Tanimura"
msgid "So you're okay with that kind of thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15264_Chihiro"
msgid "Of course not!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15276_Chihiro"
msgid "But I might not mind if it was Prince Genji."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15288_Tanimura"
msgid "What if it was me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15300_Chihiro"
msgid "Oh, you don't want to know what I'd do if you cheated on me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15312_Tanimura"
msgid "That's not fair..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15324_Tanimura"
msgid "He's an idol to a lot of men. He had power, fame, and beautiful women."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15336_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15348_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15360_Chihiro"
msgid "Which one?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15372_Tanimura"

msgctxt "15420_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15432_Chihiro"
msgid "What!? Why would you want to fight Prince Genji!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15444_Tanimura"
msgid "If both Genji and I were interested in you, there's only one way it's going to end."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15456_Chihiro"
msgid "You'd fight Genji for me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15468_Tanimura"
msgid "Sure. And I'd beat him, too."

msgctxt "15480_Chihiro"

msgctxt "15540_Chihiro"
msgid "I am, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15552_Tanimura"
msgid "But what?"
msgstr "Ma cosa?"

msgctxt "15564_Chihiro"
msgid "When I think about auditioning, I start to worry about getting scammed again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15576_Tanimura"
msgid "It wasn't your fault. You shouldn't let it get to you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15588_Chihiro"

msgctxt "15612_Chihiro"
msgid "Why don't you take me somewhere to help me forget about all this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15624_Tanimura"
msgid "Hey, you can't just run away from your problems. What if I said no more dates until you made your acting debut?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15636_Chihiro"
msgid "What!? Then I'd have to make extra sure I get cast on my next audition!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "15648_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "15660_Tanimura"

msgctxt "15696_Chihiro"

msgctxt "15708_Chihiro"
