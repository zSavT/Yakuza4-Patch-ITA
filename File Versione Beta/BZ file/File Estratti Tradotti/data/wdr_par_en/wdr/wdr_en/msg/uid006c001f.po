msgstr ""

msgctxt "4236_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4248_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4260_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4380_Noa"
msgid "Huh? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4392_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4464_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4476_Noa"
msgid "No. That's why I'm so scared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4488_Akiyama"
msgid "Try hanging men's underwear on your clothesline. He might see that and think you're living with a man. It could scare him off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4500_Noa"
msgid "Do girls really do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4512_Akiyama"
msgid "I think so. Why don't you give it a try?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4524_Noa"
msgid "Ha! That might not be a bad idea. I'll think about it. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4536_Noa"
msgid "But I don't think he follows me home. It's only when I'm here in Kamurocho, or at the train station."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4548_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh. Then it probably wouldn't work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4560_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, you could just wait and see how things play out. Kamurocho's a pretty busy neighborhood, so I doubt he'd try anything strange."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4572_Noa"
msgid "I hope not."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4584_Akiyama"
msgid "It must be tough to be such a popular girl."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4596_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. Especially if you're popular with stalkers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4608_Akiyama"
msgid "Any idea who it might be? A jilted ex-boyfriend or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4620_Noa"
msgid " Nope. I've thought about it, but I just don't know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4632_Akiyama"
msgid "Okay... It could be someone you don't even know. I think most stalkers choose their marks based on their own absurd logic."

msgctxt "4692_Akiyama"
msgid "Haha! Just kidding!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4704_Noa"
msgid "You are?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4716_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4728_Noa"
msgid "Oh... Don't joke like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4740_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4752_Akiyama"
msgid "Er, sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4764_Noa"
msgid "Hehe!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4776_Akiyama"
msgid "You're in a good mood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4788_Noa"
msgid "I suppose I am! I just enjoy talking to men more than women. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4800_Akiyama"
msgid "Is that right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4812_Noa"
msgid "Yes. That's why this job was such a good choice for me. I don't have to talk to any women at all! It's such a pain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4824_Akiyama"
msgid "You think it's a pain to talk to women? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4836_Noa"
msgid "Because they ask for your approval all the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4848_Noa"
msgid "They're always like, \"Don't you agree?\" \"You know?\" \"Right?\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4860_Noa"
msgid "That kind of thing. Talking to them makes me tired."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4872_Akiyama"
msgid "I never would've guessed you felt that way. You sound like a guy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4884_Noa"
msgid "Hahaha! People have been telling me that for years. They always say I should be more ladylike. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4896_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. Do you ever change what you do to match other girls?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4908_Noa"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4920_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, for example, when you go to lunch with your friends, do you end up ordering the same thing as the group?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4932_Akiyama"
msgid "If one girl orders the lunch special, a lot of times her friends will order the same thing. You know what I mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4944_Noa"
msgid "Oh. I suppose I don't, now that I think about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4956_Noa"
msgid "Ha! Maybe I really am like a guy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4968_Akiyama"
msgid "Heheh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4980_Akiyama"
msgid "They just like talking to each other like that. You know, having others agree with them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4992_Noa"
msgid "Well, I don't like it at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5004_Akiyama"
msgid "But men are the same way. They like to have a sympathetic ear as much as anyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5016_Akiyama"
msgid "Don't a lot of guys come to clubs like this to blow off steam from work?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5028_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, but I can't stand listening to people complain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5040_Noa"
msgid "I know it's my job so I don't say anything, but I couldn't care less."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5052_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5064_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, I know what you mean. Hearing a group of girls agreeing with each other as loudly as possible gives me a headache."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5076_Noa"
msgid "I know! I can't stand listening to it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5088_Noa"
msgid "And if you actually say what you think, they look at you like you're crazy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5100_Akiyama"
msgid "Ha, yeah. Why do they even bother asking if they don't want your opinion?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5112_Noa"
msgid "Exactly. You really understand, don't you? <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5124_Noa"
msgid "Can I ask you something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5136_Akiyama"
msgid "Hm? What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5148_Noa"
msgid "Why do men like to brag about themselves?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5160_Akiyama"
msgid "Brag?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5172_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. I like men who work hard and are able to do something well, but they don't have to make a big deal about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5184_Noa"
msgid "They talk about their little successes as if they were the most amazing things in the world. It's such a turnoff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5196_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah. They try to make themselves seem more important than they really are."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5208_Noa"
msgid "Right! And it's not just that. Guys like to brag about their friends, too. That doesn't even have anything to do with them!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5220_Akiyama"
msgid "That is annoying. They should be more reserved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5232_Akiyama"
msgid "A real man doesn't have to show all of his cards."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5244_Noa"
msgid "That's right! A guy shouldn't go bragging about how great he is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5256_Noa"
msgid "If it was my boyfriend, I'd like it better if I was the only one who really knew how hard he worked. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5268_Akiyama"
msgid "But then you can't tell right away if a guy is the hardworking type, can you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5280_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, but that's okay. As long as we can have some fun conversations. So no bragging, please!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5292_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, understood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5304_Akiyama"
msgid "They're just trying to impress you. It's a matter of pride."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5316_Noa"
msgid "Pride?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5328_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. They probably don't have much self-confidence. They know they're not really that impressive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5340_Akiyama"
msgid "But they still want pretty girls to like them, so they create an ideal version of themselves to cover up their inadequacies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5352_Noa"
msgid "But what's wrong with not being successful? The important thing is that they're trying their best. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5364_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, yeah, but they don't know you think that. So they try to look important."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5376_Noa"
msgid "And it just ends up backfiring... Don't they realize that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5388_Akiyama"
msgid "If it's true, what else can they do? Lie and say they're failures?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5400_Noa"
msgid "Well, no, of course not..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5412_Noa"
msgid "But why do they have to talk about it at all? Can't they talk about anything but themselves?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5424_Akiyama"
msgid "Talking about your successes gets the best reaction. I mean, girls always tell me how amazing my stories are."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5436_Noa"
msgid "Oh, they're just being nice. When a girl says, \"That's amazing!\" she's really thinking, \"So what?\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5448_Noa"
msgid "You didn't actually think they meant it, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5460_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5472_Noa"
msgid "What do you say when you're trying to pick up a girl?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5484_Akiyama"
msgid "Well... Why don't you tell me what you say first?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5496_Noa"
msgid "Hey, no fair! Besides, I've never tried to pick anybody up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5508_Akiyama"
msgid "What do you do if you like somebody?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5520_Noa"
msgid "I just sort of try to put out this aura that says, \"I love you!\" Then I wait for them to come to me. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5532_Akiyama"
msgid "That's not fair. You get him to do the asking so it's like you're doing him a favor by saying yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5544_Noa"
msgid "Hey, it's not like that! I just never know what will happen if I tell somebody I like them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5556_Noa"
msgid "It's easier if I know other person likes me first. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5568_Akiyama"
msgid "Okay, as long as that works for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5580_Noa"
msgid "Heh, sure does."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5592_Akiyama"
msgid "But what if he falls for another girl while you're waiting?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5604_Noa"
msgid "Oh, that's not a problem. I always turn my \"I love you!\" aura up to the max!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5616_Akiyama"
msgid "All right, if you say so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5628_Akiyama"
msgid "Can you try doing it for me now? I'd like to see this \"I love you!\" aura."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5640_Noa"
msgid "Hey, I can't just turn it on at the drop of a hat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5652_Noa"
msgid "And it's not something I can really control. It just happens when I like somebody."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5664_Akiyama"
msgid "So... You don't feel that way right now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5676_Noa"
msgid "Nope!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5700_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, oh well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5712_Akiyama"
msgid "Does that really work?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5724_Noa"
msgid "Well, it certainly seems to get their attention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5736_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm, I guess that makes a kind of sense. Men can be pretty good at noticing that a girl might be interested."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5748_Noa"
msgid "Yeah! By the time I turn my aura on, they're probably already in love with me. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5760_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah, then I'll have to be careful around you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5772_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5784_Noa"
msgid "When I was walking to work, a foreigner asked me for directions."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5820_Akiyama"
msgid "What? Haha, he tried to pick you up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5832_Noa"
msgid "Hehe, yep! It's not the first time, either. A while ago, a foreigner asked me to kiss him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5844_Akiyama"
msgid "Huh!? Kiss him!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5856_Noa"
msgid "Yes. He was about my age. There was a group of foreigners making noise on the train..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5868_Noa"
msgid "Then one suddenly ran up to me, said I was cute, and asked me to kiss him. He wouldn't give up, either!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5880_Noa"
msgid "The train was packed, too. It was so embarrassing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5892_Akiyama"
msgid "I bet he was Italian."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5904_Noa"
msgid "Huh? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5916_Akiyama"
msgid " Italians think that it's polite to try to hit on a pretty girl when they see one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5928_Noa"
msgid "Really? You mean I wasn't the only one he's said that to?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5940_Akiyama"
msgid "Maybe."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5952_Noa"
msgid "Oh. That makes me a little sad..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5964_Akiyama"
msgid "He might've thought you were interested in him. Were you staring at them or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5976_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, I guess so... And now that I think about it, everybody else was trying to ignore them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5988_Akiyama"
msgid "That must be it. You were the only one looking at them, so he thought you were encouraging him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6000_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6012_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6036_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6048_Noa"
msgid "I don't need that kind of experience! I was so embarrassed I thought I'd die."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6060_Akiyama"
msgid "What if it was somebody you liked instead of a stranger? Would you kiss him on a crowded train?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6072_Noa"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr "Cosa!?"

msgctxt "6084_Noa"
msgid "No, I couldn't do it! That kind of thing should be done in private."

msgctxt "6096_Akiyama"

msgid "Ouch..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6120_Akiyama"
msgid "What? Is something wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6132_Noa"
msgid "Not really. My thighs are a bit sore, I just had practice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6144_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh? What kind of practice?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6156_Noa"
msgid "Ballet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6168_Akiyama"
msgid "Really? You do ballet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6180_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6192_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6204_Noa"
msgid "Oh, I guess. I've been dancing for sixteen years."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6216_Akiyama"
msgid "That's a long time. Pretty incredible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6228_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, well, it's not that useful a skill."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6240_Akiyama"
msgid "Useful or not, there's value in sticking with anything for sixteen years."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6252_Noa"

msgctxt "6264_Akiyama"
msgid "Hey, that makes it sound like I never give compliments."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6276_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6288_Akiyama"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr "Davvero?"

msgctxt "6300_Akiyama"
msgid "Can you dance a little bit for me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6312_Noa"
msgid "What!? I can't dance here! And my thighs hurt too much to do it now, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6324_Akiyama"
msgid "Aw, that's too bad. I would've really liked it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6336_Noa"
msgid "Hmph. How much do you know about ballet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6348_Akiyama"
msgid "Um... Ballet dancers have to be very flexible? Oh, and they stand on their toes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6360_Noa"
msgid "Hahaha! So in other words, you don't know anything? <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6372_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, wouldn't it be a bit odd if I knew a lot about ballet without being a dancer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6384_Noa"
msgid "Maybe. All right, I'd be happy to dance for you if we get the chance someday."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6396_Akiyama"
msgid "Do you want to do it professionally?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6408_Noa"
msgid "No, not really. Besides, that competition I mentioned was in junior high."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6420_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, okay. Do you think you could've made it as a professional dancer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6432_Noa"
msgid "No... I actually got injured a few years ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6444_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh. I'm sorry for bringing it up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6456_Noa"
msgid "No, no, it's fine. It was a while ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6468_Akiyama"

msgctxt "6528_Noa"
msgid "I played racing video games when I was a kid, but I guess it was my ex-boyfriend who turned me on to live racing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6540_Akiyama"
msgid "You used to go to races with him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6552_Noa"
msgid "No, he was in the race."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6564_Akiyama"
msgid "Really? He was a racecar driver?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6576_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, well, they were private races. He wasn't a professional."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6588_Akiyama"
msgid "Wow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6600_Akiyama"
msgid "You'd probably be an expensive girlfriend if you like cars."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6612_Noa"
msgid "Yeah, a lot of guys don't even have a car. I don't get it. Don't they want one?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6624_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, it's tough. Even if they do get one, girls can be picky about what kind it is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6636_Noa"
msgid "Oh, I don't care about that. As long as it's fast!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6648_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6660_Noa"
msgid "Of course. He wouldn't race if he didn't."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6672_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah. So it all comes back to racing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6684_Akiyama"
msgid "Were you just pretending to like it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6696_Noa"
msgid "Nope. Maybe I'm just easily influenced."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6708_Noa"
msgid "Apparently, I started ballet because I saw an anime about it and told my parents that was what I wanted to do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6720_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, kids can be pretty impressionable. But here you are, still dancing sixteen years later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6732_Noa"
msgid "Hehe, yeah. It doesn't take much to get me excited about something, but once I am, I don't change my mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6744_Akiyama"
msgid "I'm envious. I tend not to stick with things myself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6756_Noa"
msgid "Hmm. Would you like to come with me to a race sometime? You might get hooked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6768_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, that wouldn't be so bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6780_Akiyama"
msgid "Do you like to drive fast yourself? Always breaking the speed limit, that kind of thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6792_Noa"
msgid "Haha! No, I just like to watch. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6804_Akiyama"
msgid "But the faster the better, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6816_Noa"
msgid "Of course. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6828_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. I don't know if I'd like to go driving with you. I'd feel pressured to floor it the whole time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6840_Noa"
msgid "Hehe, maybe you should give it a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6852_Akiyama"
msgid "I think I'll pass."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6864_Noa"
msgid "My brother got in a huge fight with my mom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6876_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh? What was it about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6888_Noa"
msgid "He's been spending all his time playing video games instead of studying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6900_Akiyama"
msgid "Video games, huh? Has he just started playing them?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6912_Noa"
msgid "No, he's been a gamer since he was little. He did start playing online games recently, though. That's when he stopped studying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6924_Noa"
msgid "Eventually my mom just snapped."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6936_Akiyama"
msgid "That's too bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6948_Noa"
msgid "Heh, you know, I like to play the occasional video game myself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6960_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, do you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6972_Noa"
msgid "Yep. What about you? Do you play video games?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6984_Akiyama"
msgid "Not really. I play pachinko from time to time, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "6996_Noa"
msgid "Ah. Well, some video games can be pretty fun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7008_Akiyama"
msgid "Really? What kind of games?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7020_Noa"
msgid "I like racing games. They're my favorite. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7032_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh yes, I remember. You said you love cars."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7044_Noa"
msgid "I do. It's exciting when you manage to drift around a corner at top speed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7056_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh. Maybe I should give racing games a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7068_Akiyama"
msgid "You know, love is like a game. And I'm quite the player."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7080_Noa"
msgid "Oh, please. That's pretty funny."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7092_Akiyama"
msgid "No, really. It can be a fun to think up ways to hit on a particular girl."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7104_Noa"
msgid "But love isn't a game! Don't you care about the girl's feelings?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7116_Akiyama"
msgid "Of course I do. You have to consider their feelings to convince them to come home with you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7128_Noa"
msgid "But the girl might take you seriously! Think of how heartbroken she'd be."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7140_Noa"
msgid "I didn't think you were such an insensitive guy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7152_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7164_Akiyama"
msgid "I'm pretty good at the game of finance. I have to admit, I'm a pro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7176_Noa"
msgid "Haha! The game of finance? I was talking about video games, you know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7188_Akiyama"
msgid "But finance can be like a video game! You can trade stocks online these days."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7200_Noa"
msgid "You can? That sounds interesting. I'd like to give that a try sometime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7212_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, but it's still serious business..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7224_Noa"
msgid "I know. The risk would make it exciting!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7236_Akiyama"
msgid "Ha! Maybe you should try it then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7248_Noa"
msgid "Ugh. I don't feel so good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7260_Akiyama"
msgid "What's wrong?"
msgstr "Che succede?"

msgctxt "7272_Noa"
msgid "Too much cake... I went to one of those all-you-can-eat places."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7284_Akiyama"
msgid "Cake, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7296_Noa"
msgid "Yep! I love it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7308_Akiyama"
msgid "What kind of cake did you eat?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7320_Noa"
msgid "Let's see... Strawberry shortcake, chestnut cream, and chocolate. I kept eating those three over and over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7332_Akiyama"
msgid "That seems a little boring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7344_Noa"
msgid "Why do you say that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7356_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, I've heard about lots of amazing cakes with fancy names."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7368_Akiyama"
msgid "And the ones you chose are pretty simple."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7380_Noa"
msgid "Hmph. Well, those are the ones I like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7392_Noa"
msgid "I'm sorry I'm not some kind of cake gourmet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7404_Akiyama"
msgid "Sorry..."
msgstr "Scusa..."

msgctxt "7416_Akiyama"
msgid "Invite me the next time you go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7428_Noa"
msgid "Hmm? You like cakes too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7440_Akiyama"
msgid "Not really. I'm just curious. But a guy can't go to one of those places by himself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7452_Akiyama"
msgid "So I thought I could go with you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7464_Noa"
msgid "Heh, that makes sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7476_Noa"
msgid "Although, the owners wouldn't like it if a big guy showed up and ate all of their food."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7488_Akiyama"
msgid "No need to worry about that. I can't eat very many sweets."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7500_Noa"
msgid "Okay. Maybe we can go together next time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7512_Akiyama"
msgid "That'd be nice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7524_Akiyama"
msgid "Don't you gain weight eating like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7536_Noa"
msgid "Haha, nope! Not while I'm doing ballet. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7548_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah. That explains it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7560_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. I couldn't eat sweets if I thought I might get fat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7572_Akiyama"
msgid "But you ate too much this time, right? Maybe you should watch it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7584_Noa"
msgid "Hahaha! I was just trying to get my money's worth! Those places aren't cheap, you know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7596_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah, okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7608_Akiyama"
msgid "Is that customer from before still giving you trouble?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7620_Noa"
msgid "Actually, he came to the club today."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7632_Noa"
msgid "He kept asking all these personal questions. I don't think he knows that I caught him stalking me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7644_Akiyama"
msgid "What did he ask you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7656_Noa"
msgid "Like, do I ever go out on dates with other customers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7668_Noa"
msgid "And do I like to go out drinking after I get off work?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7680_Akiyama"
msgid "What did you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7692_Noa"
msgid "Well, I told him that I usually go straight home after work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7704_Noa"
msgid "And he said, \"You're lying! I know it!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7716_Akiyama"
msgid "What a creep."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7728_Noa"
msgid "I know! Oh, why does this have to happen to me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7740_Akiyama"
msgid "When you first met him, did you notice anything strange?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7752_Noa"
msgid "No, he was just a normal customer. But after a while, he started to change."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7764_Akiyama"
msgid "Maybe there's something about you that drives men insane..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7776_Noa"
msgid "What!? Are you saying it's my fault!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7788_Akiyama"
msgid "Are you going to tell the police?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7800_Noa"
msgid "I can't. He's a customer. I don't wanna cause trouble for the club."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7812_Akiyama"
msgid "But he's the one causing trouble. The club would want to help you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7824_Noa"
msgid "Hmm. Okay, I'll talk to the manager."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7836_Akiyama"
msgid "Good idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7848_Noa"
msgid "I wish all of my customers were like you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7860_Akiyama"
msgid "Just leave him be. When he realizes you're with me, he'll give up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7872_Noa"
msgid "But what if something happens?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7884_Akiyama"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7896_Noa"
msgid "What if... What if he attacked you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7908_Akiyama"
msgid "Don't worry about that. If anything did happen, I can take care of myself. Trust me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7920_Noa"
msgid "You can? Oh, I'm still worried. Just be careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7932_Akiyama"
msgid "I will."
msgstr "Certo."

msgctxt "7944_Noa"
msgid "Haha! You're so funny!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7956_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7968_Noa"
msgid "What? Is something wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7980_Akiyama"
msgid "Not really... But you touch people a lot while you're talking to them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7992_Noa"
msgid "I do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8004_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. You don't even seem to notice it. Maybe you've been doing it with your stalker, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8016_Noa"
msgid "Maybe I have..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8028_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. That could be part of the problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8040_Noa"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8052_Akiyama"
msgid "When a woman touches a man like that, she sends him a pretty strong message. He starts to think she really likes him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8064_Noa"
msgid "He does?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8076_Akiyama"
msgid "You have to watch who you're talking to, especially if it's a guy who doesn't have much experience with women."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8088_Noa"
msgid "Why is that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8100_Akiyama"
msgid "If a guy usually can't get a girl to give him a second glance, what happens if one suddenly starts holding his hand or touching his shoulder?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8112_Akiyama"
msgid "He gets the wrong idea. I mean, girls don't do that unless they like someone, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8124_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. Maybe that's what happened with my customer..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8136_Akiyama"
msgid "He should be responsible for his own actions, but you might want to be a little more careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8148_Noa"
msgid "I will. You're really perceptive. I never would have thought of that. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8160_Akiyama"
msgid "Heheh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8172_Akiyama"
msgid "You shouldn't touch your customers. They'll think it's okay to touch you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8184_Noa"
msgid "What!? They'd really think that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8196_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. You're touching them, right? It's only natural for them to consider touching you back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8208_Akiyama"
msgid "Or maybe something more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8220_Noa"
msgid "I see."
msgstr "Capisco."

msgctxt "8232_Akiyama"
msgid "They're probably waiting for the right time to make a move."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8244_Noa"
msgid "Oh no. I was just trying to talk to people. This is so scary..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8256_Akiyama"
msgid "You have to get rid of that habit. Especially if you do it without noticing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8268_Noa"
msgid "You're right. But how can I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8280_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. How about always keeping something in your hands? Like a handkerchief."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8292_Noa"
msgid "Hey, that's not a bad idea. I'll give that a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8304_Noa"
msgid "You're pretty smart, you know. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8316_Akiyama"
msgid "Uh-oh! You touched me again!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8328_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "8340_Akiyama"
msgid "This could take a while..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8352_Noa"
msgid "Hehe. I think you're right. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8364_Noa"
msgid "Oh... How long is this going to last?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8376_Akiyama"
msgid "What?"
msgstr "Cosa?"

msgctxt "8388_Noa"
msgid "This stalker... It feels like he's been bothering me forever."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8400_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. You could take a taxi to and from work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8412_Noa"
msgid "That'd be too expensive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8424_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah, that's true. What if you asked another hostess to walk home with you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8436_Noa"
msgid "Um... I don't want to tell the other girls about this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8448_Akiyama"
msgid "Don't you have any friends here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8460_Noa"
msgid "It's not about friendship. We just don't talk about our private lives very much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8472_Akiyama"
msgid "If that's the case, it's possible the other girls are having similar problems and you don't even know it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "8484_Noa"
msgid "Oh. I didn't think of that..."

msgctxt "9036_Noa"

msgctxt "9048_Noa"

msgctxt "9144_Noa"

msgctxt "9168_Noa"

msgctxt "9228_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, if you say so. Do you need earplugs or something?"

msgctxt "9240_Noa"

msgctxt "9252_Akiyama"
msgid "That can't be good for your ears..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9264_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "9276_Noa"
msgid "What's wrong with just hanging out? I think that would be plenty of fun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9288_Akiyama"
msgid "What about going to a movie or an amusement park?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9300_Noa"

msgid "I don't think we have the same tastes. Why would you want to play video games at home when you're on a date?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9348_Noa"
msgid "Because it'd be fun to play video games with a guy I like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9360_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. If a girl said she wanted to go home to play video games during our date, I don't know what I'd think."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9372_Noa"
msgid "Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9384_Noa"
msgid "But then, I'm easily affected by other people. If my date wanted to do something I'd normally find odd, I'd probably give it a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9396_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh. Flexibility is definitely valuable, especially for a ballet dancer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9408_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "9444_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. I wish I could do that too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9456_Akiyama"
msgid "Really? You'd like to be a race queen?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9468_Noa"
msgid "Yep! Every time I go to a race, I think of how much fun it would be. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9480_Akiyama"
msgid "They do add something to the race, don't they?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9492_Noa"
msgid "Yeah! They make it a lot more fun to watch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9504_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm... You know, it's good for the audience, but what about the drivers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9516_Noa"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9528_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, it must be hard to concentrate with pretty girls in bathing suits running around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9540_Noa"
msgid "Hahaha! Don't worry about them. Once the race starts, race queens are the last thing on their minds. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9552_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, yeah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9564_Akiyama"
msgid "Maybe you could dress up like one here. You could have a race queen day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9576_Noa"
msgid "What!? We couldn't do that at the club!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9588_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, it wouldn't be so bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9600_Noa"
msgid "But it wouldn't mean anything without the cars!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9612_Akiyama"
msgid "I don't know about that. Pretty girls in bathing suits would mean a lot to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9624_Noa"
msgid "Ugh, why is it that men only ever have one thing on their minds?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9636_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9648_Akiyama"
msgid "Wouldn't that be embarrassing? I mean, you'd be in a bathing suit. A pretty skimpy one, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9660_Noa"
msgid "Ha, I don't mind! I'm used to wearing leotards for ballet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9672_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, that's right. So you're used to having people stare at you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9684_Noa"
msgid "Yep. And you don't have to dance as a race queen, so it'd be much easier."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9696_Akiyama"
msgid "Okay. It might be a good fit for you, then. You're certainly pretty enough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9708_Noa"
msgid "Hehe, thank you! <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9720_Noa"
msgid "The other day, one of the kids at my ballet class said－"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9732_Akiyama"
msgid "Wait, what? You're a ballet teacher too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9744_Noa"
msgid "Oh, yes! I teach ballet to kids once a week. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"

msgctxt "9756_Akiyama"
msgid "I knew you danced, but I had no idea you taught."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9768_Noa"
msgid "Heh, yeah. It's a lot of fun!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9780_Noa"
msgid "Anyway, I usually go to class without any makeup on, but this time I went completely made up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9792_Noa"
msgid "All of the girls kept saying how cute I was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9804_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh, I bet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9816_Noa"
msgid "Then one of them said, \"You look a hundred times better than usual!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9828_Akiyama"
msgid "Ha! That's not the kind of compliment you really want to get, is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9840_Noa"
msgid "Oh, I thought it was hilarious! I mean, I'm a hundred times better looking with makeup!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9852_Akiyama"
msgid "So, you look pretty terrible without makeup, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9864_Noa"
msgid "Yeah! I hope you never see me without it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9876_Akiyama"
msgid "You know, girls always say that, but it can't be that bad. I'd like to see you without makeup."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9888_Noa"
msgid "No! It's never going to happen! Forget about it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9900_Akiyama"
msgid "Whoa. Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9912_Akiyama"
msgid "Kids are so innocent. They just say whatever pops into their heads."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9924_Noa"
msgid "I know. They don't mean anything by it, so it doesn't bother me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9936_Noa"
msgid "And they're so cute! Seeing the little girls in my class dancing! It's adorable! <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9948_Akiyama"
msgid "I guess that's ballet for you. A world of innocent, cute little girls."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9960_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. You should stay away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9972_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah, yeah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9984_Akiyama"
msgid "What do you do to look a hundred times better?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9996_Noa"
msgid "Haha! Well, kids exaggerate everything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10008_Akiyama"
msgid "True enough. I once heard a boy telling another he owed him a billion yen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10020_Noa"
msgid "Right. They don't know how big a number that is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10032_Akiyama"
msgid "So makeup doesn't make you a hundred times more beautiful, then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10044_Noa"
msgid "I'm afraid not. Maybe ten times. Haha! <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10056_Noa"
msgid "Um, what do you think of wearing an all-denim outfit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10068_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm? Why do you ask?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10080_Noa"
msgid "Well, my friend went out on a date, and the guy showed up wearing a jean jacket and blue jeans!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10092_Noa"
msgid "Can you believe that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10104_Akiyama"
msgid "That's a little much. Doesn't that guy have any fashion sense?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10116_Noa"
msgid "I know! A completely denim outfit? Unbelievable!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10128_Akiyama"
msgid "Didn't your friend know how the guy dressed before going out with him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10140_Noa"
msgid "She said he's normally okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10152_Akiyama"
msgid "Aw, maybe he wanted to get a new outfit for his date and went a bit overboard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10164_Noa"
msgid "Haha! That's probably it. But still, what was he thinking!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10176_Akiyama"
msgid "What's wrong with that? Denim looks good on some people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10188_Noa"
msgid "What!? I'm talking head to toe, here! Head to toe!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10200_Akiyama"
msgid "So? What's the big deal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10212_Noa"
msgid "It's... It's just not done. I wouldn't wanna be seen in public with somebody like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10224_Noa"
msgid "It'd take a serious weirdo to think that looks good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10236_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10248_Akiyama"
msgid "That was the style back in the day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10260_Noa"
msgid "What!? You're kidding!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10272_Akiyama"
msgid "No, really. Let me see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10284_Akiyama"
msgid "It was probably before you were born. Thirty years ago, maybe. Men and women used to dress like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10296_Noa"
msgid "Huh. That's news to me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10308_Akiyama"
msgid "But it does look a little unusual these days."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10320_Noa"
msgid "Well, yeah! More than a little!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10332_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10344_Noa"
msgid "One of my customers got mad at me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10356_Akiyama"
msgid "What happened?"
msgstr "Che è successo?"

msgctxt "10368_Noa"
msgid "Oh, I was talking about how my ex-boyfriend told me that I should take cooking classes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10380_Akiyama"
msgid "Then what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10392_Noa"
msgid "And I said going to classes is a big pain. I mean, you can learn to cook from books. So I never went."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10404_Noa"
msgid "Then this customer said, \"Cooking is an elegant balance of technique and sensitivity! You can't learn that from reading a book!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10416_Akiyama"
msgid "Ah. I understand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10428_Akiyama"
msgid "He must have a short temper. He shouldn't have snapped at you like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10440_Noa"
msgid "Yeah... But to tell you the truth, I've been thinking about what he said."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10452_Akiyama"
msgid "What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10464_Noa"
msgid "I should study cooking properly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10476_Noa"
msgid "Cooking's an important thing to be able to do, and I might as well learn the right way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10488_Akiyama"
msgid "So you can't cook at all, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10500_Noa"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10512_Akiyama"
msgid "I see..."
msgstr "Capisco..."

msgctxt "10524_Akiyama"
msgid "Why'd he get so mad about something like that? It's not like he's your father."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10536_Noa"
msgid "Yeah... He just took the whole thing so seriously."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10548_Akiyama"
msgid "Hmm. Maybe he wasn't really mad at you. He might have just been trying to help."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10560_Noa"
msgid "You think so?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10572_Akiyama"
msgid "Sure. It sounds like he really cares about cooking. That may have been all it was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10584_Akiyama"
msgid "He was probably more excited than angry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10596_Noa"
msgid "Huh. Maybe you're right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10608_Akiyama"
msgid "Heh. And you know, he might've known what he was talking about. Maybe you should take cooking classes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10620_Akiyama"
msgid "I mean, do you know how to cook at all?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10632_Noa"
msgid "Hehe, nope!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10644_Akiyama"
msgid "Haha. At least you're honest."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10656_Akiyama"
msgid "I think he's right. If you're not going to take cooking seriously, you probably shouldn't learn at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10668_Noa"
msgid "You really agree with him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10680_Akiyama"
msgid "Sure. But it's nothing to get angry about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10692_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. I was pretty shocked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10704_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, maybe you can use this as an opportunity to start learning seriously."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10716_Noa"
msgid "Okay. I could ask my mom!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10728_Akiyama"
msgid "That's not a bad idea. Good luck."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10740_Noa"
msgid "I'm starting to think I really am stupid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10752_Akiyama"
msgid "What? Why do you say that? Did another customer get mad at you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10764_Noa"
msgid "Yeah. He said I didn't know anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10776_Akiyama"
msgid "What ended up happening?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10788_Noa"
msgid "He kept using all these words I'd never heard of. I couldn't follow what he was saying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10800_Noa"
msgid "Something about credit default swaps?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10812_Noa"
msgid "I had no idea what he was talking about!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10824_Akiyama"
msgid "Most people don't know about that kind of thing. You'd have to be in finance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10836_Noa"
msgid "Oh. So that's a specialized term?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10848_Akiyama"
msgid "Yes. You could hear it on the news, but you don't use it outside of financial institutions."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10860_Noa"
msgid "Okay. Man, I hate it when people just assume everyone should understand everything they say."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10872_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. Don't worry, you're not stupid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10884_Noa"
msgid "Hehe. Thanks. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10896_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "10908_Noa"
msgid "You think so?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10920_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. He was probably teasing you. Or he was showing off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10932_Noa"
msgid "Oh. I thought it was my fault for not understanding."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10944_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, you could try studying financial terms. Then you can surprise him next time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10956_Noa"
msgid "Haha, yeah! He'd be pretty surprised if I suddenly became an expert!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10968_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. Anyway, it's nothing to get upset about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10980_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "10992_Akiyama"

msgctxt "11004_Noa"
msgid "Huh? You think I'm stupid, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11016_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, somebody your age who reads a fair amount would understand it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11028_Noa"
msgid "Oh... I didn't know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11040_Akiyama"
msgid "Why don't you read a book once in a while? They can be pretty interesting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11052_Noa"
msgid "Er, I'm not much of a reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11064_Noa"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "11592_Noa"

msgctxt "11880_Noa"

msgctxt "11892_Akiyama"

msgctxt "11904_Noa"

msgctxt "11916_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "11940_Akiyama"

msgctxt "11952_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "11964_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12000_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12012_Akiyama"
msgid "You'll just have to move. It's not safe around your apartment anymore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12024_Noa"
msgid "But he can just follow me home again, can't he?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12036_Akiyama"
msgid "Then you'll have to quit your job and move far away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12048_Noa"
msgid "I don't wanna do that! I'd have to leave you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12060_Noa"

msgctxt "12072_Akiyama"

msgctxt "12084_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12096_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12108_Akiyama"
msgid "Let's just see what happens. Neither of your stalkers have done anything to you yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12120_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12132_Noa"
msgid "Don't you care if something happens to me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12144_Akiyama"

msgid "Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12228_Akiyama"
msgid "What?"
msgstr "Cosa?"

msgctxt "12240_Noa"
msgid "I think you'd come to places like this even if you did have a girlfriend."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12252_Akiyama"
msgid "Of course. Why would having a girlfriend make a difference?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12264_Noa"
msgid "Oh. You'd really still come?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12276_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah. So?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12288_Noa"
msgid "Well, I wouldn't want my boyfriend to come here and drink with other girls."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12300_Akiyama"
msgid "I can understand that, but it's not like I'd be cheating on a girlfriend by coming here, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12312_Noa"
msgid "But I work here. I know how customers come to depend on their hostesses. Someone with a girlfriend shouldn't do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12324_Akiyama"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12336_Noa"
msgid "So you'd still come."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12348_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12360_Noa"
msgid "Really? You'd stop going to hostess clubs?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12372_Akiyama"
msgid "I said so, didn't I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12384_Noa"
msgid "Hehe. That's a relief."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12396_Akiyama"
msgid "Why do you say that?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12420_Akiyama"
msgid "...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12432_Akiyama"
msgid "It depends. I might go once in a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12444_Noa"
msgid "Once in a while? When you can sneak away from your girlfriend, you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12456_Akiyama"
msgid "That's not what I meant. I just don't know what I might do. I'll make up my mind when the time comes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12468_Noa"
msgid "But I wanna know now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12480_Akiyama"
msgid "I'm just not sure. I might, and I might not."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12492_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12504_Noa"
msgid "Um, can I ask you something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12516_Akiyama"
msgid "Yes?"

msgctxt "12528_Noa"

msgctxt "12540_Akiyama"

msgctxt "12552_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12564_Akiyama"
msgid "Heheh."

msgctxt "12576_Noa"
msgid "Okay. What do you think of girls who aren't very ladylike?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12588_Akiyama"
msgid "There's more to that question, isn't there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12600_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12612_Noa"
msgid "What!? Um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12624_Noa"
msgid "Okay, then... What do you think of... girls like me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12636_Akiyama"
msgid "I don't dislike them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12648_Noa"
msgid "Hmm. That's a little vague. You don't dislike them, but you don't like them either?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12660_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, if I had to choose one, I'd say I like them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12672_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12684_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12696_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12708_Akiyama"
msgid "Sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12720_Akiyama"
msgid "I can't say in front of you."

msgctxt "12744_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12792_Akiyama"
msgid "Told you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12804_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12828_Akiyama"

msgctxt "13524_Akiyama"
