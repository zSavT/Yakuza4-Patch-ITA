msgctxt "204_Mika"
msgid "You still don't get it? I thought the Legendary Yakuza would be quicker on the uptake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "216_Mika"
msgid "I use old boyfriends like RA as a front, while I lead from behind. That's how our gang really works."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "228_Kiryu"
msgid "What's the point of that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "240_Mika"
msgid "If it got out that the boss was a chick, the other gangs would come try and pick a fight with us. I didn't want to deal with that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "252_Mika"
msgid "Fooling around with this gang is just a hobby of mine. Things got a little out of hand this time, but I sure had fun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "264_Kiryu"
msgid "If that's all you care about, why bother with a tough town like Kamurocho?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "276_Mika"
msgid "That's got nothing to do with me. RA was all excited about something that was going down in Kamurocho."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "288_Mika"
msgid "He started acting all tough, saying, \"I'm gonna make you the queen of Kamurocho!\" What a joke that was. You men are all morons."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "300_Kiryu"
msgid "So what're you going to do now? Don't tell me I have to fight you too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "312_Mika"
msgid "Haha! You're hilarious! I mean, how can you even say that with a straight face?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "324_Mika"
msgid "I wish someone had taken you down before my true identity got out, but now everything's changed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "336_Mika"
msgid "There's not much point in keeping this up if the Tojo Clan's Fourth Chairman is after me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "348_Mika"
msgid "As of today, the Kanto Gangsters are no more! I'll find some other way to have fun. See ya."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "372_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "384_Mika"
msgid "Oh, and Fourth Chairman? I should tell you that just before I showed up in Kamurocho, a kind of strange message came my way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "396_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah?"
msgstr "SÃ¬?"

msgctxt "408_Mika"
msgid "It said that if we defeated you, we could have all the money we wanted."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "420_Mika"
msgid "Of course, it was RA they contacted since he was supposed to be the boss. He was planning to use some of that money for the bounty he offered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "432_Mika"
msgid "Looks like somebody's backing the gangs that are trying to take you down. I'd watch my back if I were you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "444_Kiryu"
msgid "Hold on! Who's behind this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Mika"
msgid "Beats me."
msgstr "Non lo so."

msgctxt "468_Mika"
msgid "They just contacted us through RA's cell phone. RA's never even met them, so there's no point in going after him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_Mika"
msgid "Well, it's about time for me to be on my way. Later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Akaishi"
msgid "Hmm... To think the boss was a woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "552_Akaishi"
msgid "So, everything we had heard about the boss all came from her former boyfriends? Women truly are frightening."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Kiryu"
msgid "They can be. Anyway, they won't be a problem now. Still, I don't understand the younger generation and their frivolous attitudes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Akaishi"
msgid "Actually, I'm more concerned about the message Mika mentioned. Someone's offering money to whoever defeats you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah... But there's nothing we can do with that information alone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Akaishi"
msgid "Right. We'll just have to wait and see then. The Kamurocho Guard will do whatever it can to gather more information."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Kiryu"
msgid "I'd appreciate that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Akaishi"
msgid "Still, we couldn't even figure out that the boss was a woman, so please don't get your hopes up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Akaishi"
msgid "Oh, but we did hear that some holdouts from the Kanto Gangsters are still here in town."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Akaishi"
msgid "Please take care of yourself. Also, here's your reward."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Akaishi"
msgid "This equipment is from the shop owner you helped. He asked me to thank you for getting rid of the gang around his store."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Akaishi"
msgid "We'll be seeing you. Your help is always appreciated."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Gangster-looking Man"
msgid "Uh-oh, they're on to us. What should we do, Mika?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Woman Called Mika"
msgid "This all happened because you opened your big mouth and started offering a bounty on him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Woman Called Mika"
msgid "Instead, you put a target on your own head."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Gangster-looking Man"
msgid "Huh? You think it's my fault? We just got unlucky!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Kiryu"
msgid "A bounty? So you're RA?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Gangster-looking Man"
msgid "Shit, this guy even knows my name? Man, did I really blow this? This is bad..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Kiryu"
msgid "Well, what's your next move? I get the feeling you're not all that serious about taking over Kamurocho."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_RA"
msgid "Oh, yeah? I'm serious all right. Boss's orders."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Kiryu"
msgid "Boss? You're not the boss? Where is he then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_RA"
msgid "Ah, who cares about that guy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Mika"
msgid "I wouldn't say that about the boss if I were you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_RA"
msgid "Yeah, yeah, my bad. Anyway, sorry for the wait, Kiryu-san."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_RA"
msgid "The others are gonna be bummed after I take you out 'cause then there won't be a bounty to collect anymore. But, oh well. Life's a bitch, then you die."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_RA"
msgid "Thought we could have some fun getting everybody psyched for our little Kiryu Hunt. Too bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Kiryu"
msgid "You mean you're going to take me on?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_RA"
msgid "Looks like I'm the only one who can. I've been watching you from up here, you're pretty damn strong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_RA"
msgid "After the third fight or so, I kind of figured it'd have to be someone really strong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Kiryu"
msgid "And you're the strongest one in your gang?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_RA"
msgid "Sorta. Anyway, don't want to keep the boss waiting, so let's head into the final round!"
