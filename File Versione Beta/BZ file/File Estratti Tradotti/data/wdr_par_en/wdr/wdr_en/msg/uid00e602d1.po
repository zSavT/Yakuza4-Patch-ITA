msgctxt "368_Ueda"

msgctxt "416_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "With the skill and intensity he's got, I'd like to see him make something only he's capable of."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Kiryu"
msgid "So you think he ought to go into business on his own, rather than just opening a new branch of Kyushu No. 1 Star."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Ueda"
msgid "That's how you really feel?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Owner of Kyushu No. 1 Star"
msgid "That's right..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Ueda"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "524_Kiryu"

msgstr "Grazie."

msgctxt "536_Ueda"
msgid "Matsuyama-san really seemed to have his heart set on opening a new branch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, he seemed pretty upset about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Ueda"
msgid "Kiryu-san, I know it's none of my business, but do you think it would be okay to let Matsuyama-san know how the owner really feels about this whole thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Kiryu"
msgid "Remember what the owner said? There are some things you have to figure out on your own."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Ueda"
msgid "I can see where he's coming from and all, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, it seems he will never know otherwise. I'll see what I can do to help."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Ueda"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Kiryu"

msgctxt "632_Ueda"
msgid "Uh, well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Kiryu"
msgid "No? Oh, well. It's not like he could've gone far. Let's split up and look for him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Ueda"
msgid "Sounds good. I'll call you if I find him!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure. I'll do the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Kiryu"
msgid "(He just ran off with his uniform still on, so he should be easy to spot. I should try asking if anybody saw him.)"

msgctxt "704_Annoyed Man"
