"Sacramento, California, 95814, or by telephone at 916.445.1254. California "
"residents expressly agree to waive California Civil Code Sec. 1542, which "
"states: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor "
"does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the "
"release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement "
"with the debtor.\" 7. INDEMNIFICATION Upon a request by SEGA, you agree to "
"defend, indemnify, and hold SEGA and its affiliates harmless from all "
"liabilities, claims, losses, costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, "
"that arise from (a) your use of, or activities in connection with the Game "
"Software; (b) any violation of the Agreement by you; or (c) any allegation "
"that any content that you make available via the Game Software infringes or "
"otherwise violates the copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or other "
"intellectual property or other rights of any third party. SEGA reserves the "
"right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of "
"any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you "
"will cooperate with SEGA in asserting any available defenses. 8. E-MAIL, "
"MESSAGING, BLOGGING AND CHAT SEGA may make email, messaging, blogging, or "
"chat (collectively,  \"Communication Software\") available through the Game "
"Software, either directly or through a third-party provider. SEGA is not "
"responsible for communications made by other users via the Communication "
"Software. We are not responsible for communications made by you via the "
"Communication Software. You acknowledge and agree that your communications "
"made via the Communication Software are public and not private "
"communications and that you have no expectation of privacy concerning your "
"use of the Communication Software. You acknowledge and agree that personal "
"information that you communicate via the Communication Software may be seen "
"and used by others and may result in widespread distribution of such "
"information. We strongly encourage you not to disclose any personal "
"information in your public communications via the Communication Software "
"unless you wish such information to be made permanently available to the "
"public. 9. INTERNATIONAL USE Although the Game Software may be accessible "
"worldwide, we make no representation that the Game Software or related "
"materials are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the "
"United States, and accessing them from territories where the content is "
"illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Game Software from "
"other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for "
"compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. "
"Any offer and/or information made in connection with the Game Software is "
"void where prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, the Game Software "
"may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national resident of) "
"any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury "
"Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department "
"of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. By accessing and using the "
"Game Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under "
"control of, or a national resident of any such country  or on any such "
"list. 10. TERMINATION AND SURVIVABILITY OF TERMS The Agreement set forth "
"herein continue to remain in full force and effect until such time as "
"terminated by either party. You agree and acknowledge that you are not "
"entitled to any refund for any amounts which were paid to SEGA prior to any "
"termination. You retain full discretion to end or terminate your account, "
"if applicable, and discontinue use of the Game Software at any time, "
"pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Without prejudice to any other "
"rights of SEGA, this Agreement shall terminate automatically if you fail to "
"comply with its terms and conditions. Upon termination, you must destroy "
"all copies of the Game Software. The provisions of Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, "
"10, 11 and 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 11. "
"INJUNCTION Because SEGA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this "
"Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that SEGA shall be "
"entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to take such "
"action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other "
"equitable remedies, in addition to any other remedies available to it under "
"the applicable law. 12. MISCELLANEOUS This Agreement represents the "
"complete agreement between you and SEGA concerning the Game Software and "
"supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or "
"understandings between you and SEGA (whether negligently or innocently made "
"but excluding those made fraudulently),  regarding the same subject matter. "
"SEGA reserves the right to amend this  Agreement at any time, at its sole "
"discretion. If any part of the Agreement is determined to be invalid or "
"unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the "
"warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the "
"invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, "
"enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original "
"provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. Any "
"failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of the Agreement or "
"related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. "
"SEGA may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. "
"Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of  "
"your rights or obligations under the Agreement without SEGA's express prior "
"written consent. SEGA's performance of the Agreement is subject to existing "
"laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Agreement is in "
"derogation of SEGA's right to comply with governmental, court, and law "
"enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Game "
"Software or information provided to or gathered by SEGA with respect to "
"such use. In addition to any excuse provided by applicable law, we shall be "
"excused from liability for non-delivery or delay in delivery of the Game "
"Software arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, whether or "
"not foreseeable by either party, including but not limited to, labor "
"disturbance, war, terrorism, fire, denial of service attack, internet "
"outages, accident, adverse weather, inability to secure transportation, "
"governmental act or regulation, and other causes or events beyond our "
"reasonable control, whether or not similar to those which are enumerated "
"above. The parties agree that all correspondence relating to this Agreement "
"shall be written in the English language. This Agreement shall be construed "
"under California law as such law is applied to agreements between "
"California residents entered into and to be performed within California, "
"except as governed by federal law, and you consent to the exclusive "
"jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. "
