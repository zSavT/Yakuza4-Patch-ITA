msgctxt "732_Akiyama"

msgctxt "744_Shiobara"
msgid "What's that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Akiyama"
msgid "It's basically trading stocks within the course of a single day."

msgctxt "828_Akiyama"
msgid "Before long, I'd made a pretty nice chunk of change."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Akiyama"

msgctxt "852_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I'd made a businessman's salary thousands of times over in\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Shiobara"
msgid "Did you lose interest in money itself?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Akiyama"
