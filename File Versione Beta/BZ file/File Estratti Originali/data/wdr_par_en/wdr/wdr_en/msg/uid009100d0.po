msgstr ""

msgctxt "5708_Sodachi"

"For an apprentice to use a Finishing Move during a fight, he must have the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5720_Sodachi"
msgid ""

msgctxt "5732_Sodachi"
msgid ""
"Only use Finishing Moves at decisive moments. In general, just believe in "

msgctxt "5996_Sodachi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6008_Sodachi"
msgid ""
"Make sure to rest frequently, as pushing your apprentices to train when "

"It's time for fighting theory part five! That means it's time to "

msgctxt "6164_Sodachi"
msgid ""
"Your ability level increases regardless of whether you win or lose, so "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6176_Sodachi"
msgid ""
"If your apprentice has a Finishing Move equipped, you can instruct him to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "6188_Sodachi"

"However, Finishing Moves are a double-edged sword. Using them will "
