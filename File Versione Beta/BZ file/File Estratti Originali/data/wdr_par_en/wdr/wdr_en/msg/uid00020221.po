"It's the truth. You look on the map, and all you'll see is some nameless "

"population."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "308_Hamazaki"

"But the truth lurking under the surface is damn sinister. The only reason "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "332_Hamazaki"

msgid "Yup. Not a pretty sight once he's done, I'll tell you that."

msgctxt "368_Hamazaki"
