msgctxt "828_Tanimura"
msgid "What?"

msgid ""
"I might as well tell you now. I'm helping Kido find his boss, Arai. He's a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Tanimura"
msgid "Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Because I can't afford to lose Arai-san. Shibata's boys are going nuts "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"They're trying to appease the Ueno Seiwa by handing him over. We have to "

msgctxt "924_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Akiyama"
msgid "Who'd imagine Arai-san would be in bed with Katsuragi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I never pegged him as the type to make a\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Tanimura"
msgid "So, what exactly was that call about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Akiyama"
msgid "Hm? Oh, that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Kido-chan was looking for Arai-san when he stumbled across the other Ueno "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008_Tanimura"

msgid ""
"Guy named Mishima. He was sworn brothers with Ihara, the guy Arai "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032_Tanimura"
msgid "So, what about him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1044_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"He's asking for police protection. In exchange, he says he'll cough up all "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056_Tanimura"
msgid "He wants the police?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1068_Akiyama"
msgid "He wants a detective he can trust."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080_Akiyama"
msgid "One that can protect him from the Ueno Seiwa Clan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1092_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1104_Akiyama"
msgid "I think you should go talk to him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1116_Tanimura"
msgid "Me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1128_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Yeah, you're a perfect fit. I mean, based on what you said, the force "
"sounds like a total snake pit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1140_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Plus you can't count on Sugiuchi-san or your superiors. What better person "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1152_Tanimura"
msgid "Why should I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1164_Akiyama"
msgid "Who knows? It might get you a step closer to the truth you're looking for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1176_Tanimura"
msgid "How do you figure?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1188_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"The recent shooting between the Ueno Seiwa Clan and Kanemura Enterprises, "
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1200_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I've got this hunch it's all connected to the case your old man was working "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1212_Akiyama"
msgid "There's just too much overlap between the main players to be a coincidence."
