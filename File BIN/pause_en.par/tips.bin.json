    "TIPS_EXPLANATION": "The police in Kamurocho have sent many of their officers out on patrol around the town to make sure they catch anyone acting suspicious. There are two types of officers: some stand guard in place and watch their surroundings, while others follow a patrol and approach shady individuals to question them. Running down the street will attract the attention of patrolling officers. You may want to enter first-person mode with <Action:Button_R3@Adventure> and check for officers before moving quickly."
