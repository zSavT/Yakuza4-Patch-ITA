msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Chihiro"
msgid "Wow, sounds fun! I've always wanted to try my hand at pachinko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Chihiro"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Tanimura"
msgid "If you have questions, you know who to ask."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Tanimura"
msgid "Ever heard of Amoebatar?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Chihiro"
msgid ""

msgctxt "536_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Tanimura"
msgid "Now, night after night, his ghost appears to wander the empty mall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Chihiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Chihiro"
msgid ""
"Oh? I already take footbaths. I fill the tub with just a bit of water and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Tanimura"
msgid "Oh yeah?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Chihiro"
msgid ""
"Yeah. Kabuki requires you to use every part of your body, so circulation is "

msgctxt "668_Chihiro"

"Do you order liver when you go out for yakiniku? They say liver's got "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Chihiro"
msgid "Wow, really? I don't eat that much liver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"They say it improves your memory. Might come in handy for memorizing your "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Chihiro"
msgid "That would be handy. I'll try eating some, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Tanimura"
msgid "Did you know pole dancing is great for working out?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Chihiro"
msgid ""
"I know! It's good for your figure, just like aerobics. I'm interested in it "

msgctxt "776_Tanimura"

"I thought you were supposed to get naked for pole dancing, but I guess you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Chihiro"
msgid "Wow, there's a sweet kind of sake? I wonder if I could drink it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Chihiro"
msgid "Wow, that's great! I'll try some next time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Tanimura"

msgctxt "956_Chihiro"
msgid ""

msgctxt "1028_Tanimura"
msgid "Try out the footbaths at Yunosono Hot Springs yet?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Tanimura"
msgid "Heh. I'm glad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Chihiro"
msgid "My skin's all shiny now too. I might become a regular there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Tanimura"
msgid "Remember those golf dates we talked about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Chihiro"
msgid ""
"It's not a bad idea for a date. But if you're not pursuing golf on your "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Tanimura"
msgid "True. Might not be the best pick for a student."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Chihiro"
msgid "But if you're paying, I'm ready whenever! Just call me up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Chihiro"
msgid "Yeah, but I can't eat it. Thanks for telling me about it, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Tanimura"
