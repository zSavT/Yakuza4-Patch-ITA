msgctxt "404_Erena"

msgctxt "416_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"It's a game for your computer or cell phone. It lets you play pachinko and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Erena"
msgid "Wow! I don't play pachinko so I never knew about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Then it'd be good practice for the real thing. Why not try it out? You "

msgctxt "524_Erena"

msgctxt "536_Akiyama"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Akiyama"
msgid "Now, night after night, his ghost appears to wander the empty mall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Erena"
msgid "No way! I want to see it for myself!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Akiyama"
msgid "That doesn't scare you in the least?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Erena"

msgctxt "596_Akiyama"

msgctxt "608_Erena"

msgctxt "692_Akiyama"

"Say, Erena, do you like liver? Liver contains this kind of acid that "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Erena"
msgid "I'm crazy about liver sashimi. I eat it all the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Erena"
