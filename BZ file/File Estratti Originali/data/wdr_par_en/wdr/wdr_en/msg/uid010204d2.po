msgctxt "228_Katsuragi"

msgctxt "360_Tanimura"

msgctxt "444_Katsuragi"

"I could give you a play-by-play down to the\r\n"

msgid ""
"True, the statute of limitations would apply...\r\n"

msgctxt "480_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Tanimura"
msgid "Sound about right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Katsuragi"

"Why did my father have to die 25 years ago?\r\n"

msgctxt "540_Katsuragi"

"Your father, the Tanimura-san of my generation,\r\n"

msgctxt "564_Tanimura"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Katsuragi"
msgid "Corruption."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Katsuragi"

msgid "Corruption... in the force?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Katsuragi"
msgid ""
"You may not know this, but the police\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Katsuragi"
msgid ""
"They concealed the real killer,\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Tanimura"
msgid "What do you mean by \"real\" killer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Katsuragi"
msgid ""
"Just what I said. Saejima popped our boys with\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Yasuko-san did mention another\r\n"
"perpetrator... So you weren't lying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "684_Katsuragi"
msgid "Your old man figured it out pretty quick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Katsuragi"
msgid ""
"What he didn't bargain for was an institution\r\n"
"that would purposely bury his work..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Katsuragi"
msgid "...Let alone bury him along with it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "720_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Who was it, then!? Who murdered my dad!?\r\n"

msgctxt "732_Katsuragi"
msgid "Heh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Tanimura"
msgid "How long have you been here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Katsuragi"
msgid "Heh, since long before you arrived."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Katsuragi"
msgid "I'd wager you saw me in the crowd, but didn't recognize me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Katsuragi"
msgid "That tells me you don't have much of a file on me. A relief, really."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Tanimura"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Katsuragi"
msgid "Now, what will it be? Shall we proceed with the deal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Tanimura"
msgid "No, let's walk and talk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Katsuragi"
msgid "Here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Around. Maybe it'll help jog your memory, y'know? I'm sure you have so much "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Katsuragi"
msgid ""
"...You really have thought this through. A moving target is a lot harder to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Tanimura"
msgid ""
"Not to mention I thought you'd appreciate a nice, long stroll through Tojo "

msgctxt "900_Katsuragi"
msgid "How thoughtful of you. Then lead the way, Tanimura-san."
