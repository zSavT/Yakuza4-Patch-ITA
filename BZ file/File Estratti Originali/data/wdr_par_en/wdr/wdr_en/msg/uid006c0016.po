msgctxt "4452_Kiryu"

msgctxt "4464_Shizuka"

"It's a process where you make someone who died from an accident or sickness "

msgctxt "4500_Shizuka"

msgctxt "4512_Kiryu"

msgctxt "4524_Shizuka"

"Yes. I'm getting to assist in the embalming process with an embalmer while "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4536_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"I've still got a lot to learn, so I'll have to work very hard to get my "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4548_Kiryu"
msgid "I see... It sounds like you're working hard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4560_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Yes I am. Unfortunately, Japan's embalming science is behind the rest of "
"the world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4572_Shizuka"
msgid "That's why I'm thinking about getting my license overseas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4584_Kiryu"
msgid "Wow. Well, I'll be on the sidelines cheering you on."

msgctxt "4596_Shizuka"

msgctxt "4608_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4632_Kiryu"
msgid "Sorry about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4644_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Oh no, don't worry about it. Compared to other countries, embalming isn't "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4656_Kiryu"
msgid "Is it common in other countries?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4668_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Yes. Unlike in Japan, embalming is much more accepted overseas, especially "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4680_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Japan's license doesn't cover all the bases, so I'd like to get another "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4692_Kiryu"
msgid "I'm starting to understand... Seems pretty tough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4704_Kiryu"
msgid "I think that's a respectable job. It's not one that just anyone can do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4716_Shizuka"
msgid "Thank you for saying that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4728_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Embalming isn't very well-known in Japan. Some people aren't very "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4740_Kiryu"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4752_Shizuka"
msgid "So I'm happy that you understand, sir."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4764_Shizuka"
msgid "I hope to get my license soon so I can start work as a real embalmer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4776_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4788_Shizuka"
msgid "Yes! Thank you. <Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4800_Kiryu"
msgid "It must be tough working two jobs. How are you holding up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4812_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"It certainly is. But my mother does help me out, and I don't work days and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4824_Kiryu"
msgid "I see... But that doesn't change that it's a tough job, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4836_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Yes. You know, embalmers only get to meet the deceased client after they've "
"received an embalming request from the family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4848_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"I suppose the same is true with people who work in funeral homes, but I've "
"always thought that it's an unusual profession."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4860_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, I'm sure you don't know most of the clients when they're alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4872_Shizuka"
msgid "Many things go through my mind when I first see our \"clients.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4884_Shizuka"
msgid "I wonder about the lives they led and their thoughts..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4896_Shizuka"
msgid "My mind is full of thoughts like that as I do my work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4908_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I'm sure their family would appreciate that. You have to trust someone to "
"take care of the remains of a loved one, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4920_Shizuka"
msgid "I wish that were always true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4932_Kiryu"
msgid "Am I wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4944_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, there are times when the family of the deceased aren't happy "
"with the results of the embalming."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4956_Kiryu"
msgid "Why's that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4968_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Well, this is a sensitive subject, but there are limits to what the "
"embalmer can do if the body is injured or damaged."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4980_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Naturally, every family has an image of their loved ones as they were in "
"life, and we can't always live up to that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4992_Kiryu"
msgid "Right... You can't always make them look like they did when they were alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5004_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Yes. It's those times that remind me of how limited our skills really are. "
"It's such a shame."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5016_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"You shouldn't feel that way. After all, you're making them look better than "
"they would if you hadn't done anything, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5028_Shizuka"
msgid "Thank you so much. Hearing you say that gives me confidence in my work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5040_Kiryu"
msgid "Do you ever make mistakes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5052_Shizuka"
msgid "Huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5064_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I mean, do you ever find that you can't get the deceased to look like they "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5076_Shizuka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5088_Kiryu"
msgid "Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I guess that wasn't a great thing to ask."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5100_Shizuka"
msgid "Oh, no... In reality, there's a limit to what's possible with embalming."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5112_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Sometimes if the body has been severely injured or decomposed, it's not "
"possible to prepare the deceased to the family's expectations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5124_Kiryu"
msgid "Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5136_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"I always do my best to help the family through their time of sorrow, but "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5148_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"You shouldn't feel that way. Our society needs to understand the limits of "
"embalming."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5160_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"You're right. It would be great if the understanding of embalming became "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5172_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5184_Shizuka"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5196_Kiryu"
msgid "I'm sure they do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5208_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"But depending on the condition of the body, we aren't always able to make "

msgid ""
"Even so, I'm sure they'd appreciate how hard you work to make them look "
"better."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5232_Kiryu"

msgctxt "5424_Kiryu"

msgctxt "5436_Shizuka"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5448_Kiryu"

msgctxt "5460_Shizuka"
msgid ""
"Women these days are so independent. Men sometimes treat women just like "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "11928_Shizuka"
msgid "Well, he was a foreigner."

msgctxt "11964_Shizuka"

msgctxt "11988_Kiryu"

msgid ""
"Of course as soon as I paid, I reached into the bag and saved the ice cream "

msgctxt "12060_Shizuka"

msgctxt "12072_Kiryu"

msgctxt "12084_Shizuka"
msgid "Yes... I couldn't just complain like that. I'd be too embarrassed."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12360_Shizuka"
msgid ""
