msgctxt "428_Noa"

msgctxt "488_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "512_Akiyama"

msgctxt "524_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Noa"
msgid "Huh? A ghost!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Noa"

msgctxt "596_Noa"

msgctxt "608_Akiyama"

msgctxt "620_Noa"

msgctxt "632_Akiyama"
msgid "Huh. You look pretty limber. I'm surprised you get stiff at all."

msgctxt "644_Noa"

msgctxt "656_Akiyama"

msgctxt "668_Akiyama"
msgid "Golf is getting pretty popular. A lot of couples go on golf dates nowadays."

msgctxt "680_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Akiyama"
msgid "I know what you mean. You're a hard hitter, huh?"

msgctxt "704_Noa"

"Say, Noa, do you like liver? Liver contains some kind of acid that reverses "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Noa"
msgid "Wow, really? I don't eat that much liver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Akiyama"
msgid "It's good for your memory too, so you'll stay sharp when you're old."

msgctxt "752_Noa"

"Hey now, that's got nothing to do with my memory. I only heard it in "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Akiyama"
msgid "They say pole dancing's great for losing weight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Noa"
msgid "It must be! Any kind of dancing burns fat all over your body."

msgctxt "800_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, that's right. You do ballet, right? I guess you don't need to slim down."

msgctxt "812_Akiyama"

"Sweet sake is all the rage now. Women like to have it at Sushi Gin these "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Noa"
msgid "Wow, they have that now? Sounds tasty!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Akiyama"

msgctxt "848_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Akiyama"

"I saw some people fighting in a parking lot. Some yakuza had this one man "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Noa"

"I did! The hot water was so refreshing! I felt brand new afterwards, like I "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Akiyama"
msgid "So, about those golf dates..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Noa"
msgid ""
"The golf course is pretty far away, though. I tried driving there one time, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Akiyama"
msgid "Guess that would make a pretty good date, too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Akiyama"
msgid "Had any liver lately?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Noa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1220_Akiyama"
msgid "About that pole dancing workout..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Noa"
msgid ""
"You mentioned this before, didn't you? Hmm... Do you want to see me pole "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1304_Noa"
