msgstr ""

msgctxt "6984_Akiyama"

msgctxt "7332_Akiyama"
msgid "Let's see... First, we'll go there. And then there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7344_Akiyama"
msgid "Oh, and we can't forget to go there. Everybody loves that place..."

msgctxt "7356_Erena"

msgctxt "7464_Akiyama"

msgctxt "7476_Erena"

msgctxt "7488_Erena"

msgctxt "7596_Akiyama"
msgid "No, I mean it."

msgctxt "7680_Akiyama"

msgctxt "7752_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7776_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah, you said that before."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "7788_Erena"

msgctxt "12240_Akiyama"

msgid ""
"Well, I don't know... I didn't hate him. And the reason I was with him in "

msgid "I'm not sure if breakin' up was the right thing to do."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12444_Erena"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12456_Akiyama"
msgid "Don't worry about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12468_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"You jumped into that relationship too quickly. You should've waited until "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12480_Erena"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12492_Akiyama"
msgid "Well... I suppose that's one way to look at it."

msgctxt "12504_Erena"
msgid "Then it don't matter if you jump into a relationship."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12516_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but I can't help but think that going out with a guy who picks you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12528_Erena"

"Oh, I'm not so sure about that. I know people who started going out that "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "12588_Akiyama"
msgid "Like what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12600_Erena"

msgctxt "12744_Akiyama"
msgid "Seriously?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "12756_Erena"
