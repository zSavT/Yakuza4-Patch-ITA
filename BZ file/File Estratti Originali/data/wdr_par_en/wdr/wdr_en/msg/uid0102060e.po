msgstr ""

msgctxt "844_Date"

msgctxt "856_Yasuko"

msgid "Saejima..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "880_Yasuko"

msgctxt "916_Date"

msgctxt "940_Yasuko"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "988_Date"
msgid "Then... he found your dad?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1000_Yasuko"
msgid "Yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1012_Date"
msgid "Well? Where was he?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"In Kansai. He had started working for a yakuza organization\r\n"

"wanted to touch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036_Date"
msgid "The Omi!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1048_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"That's right. Taiga went alone to Kansai, knowing full well\r\n"
"that my father was a yakuza, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1060_Kiryu"
msgid "Let me guess. They tried to extort him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1072_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"Exactly. A yakuza through and through, my father demanded\r\n"
"a massive sum of money in exchange for one of his kidneys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1084_Date"
msgid "How much cash are we talking here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1096_Yasuko"
msgid "Thirty million yen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1108_Date"
msgid ""
"Thirty mil!? That's a ton now, but it was a fortune back then! How was a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1120_Yasuko"
msgid "He wasn't. That was the point."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1132_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"But Taiga didn't give up. He started fighting thugs in the\r\n"
"streets of Kamurocho, trying to scrape together whatever\r\n"
"funds he could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1144_Date"
msgid "That would never work. Not for cash like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1156_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"It didn't. Not until Sasai-san from the Tojo Clan stepped\r\n"
"in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1168_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"He gave Taiga the thirty million under one condition: he\r\n"
"join the Sasai Family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1180_Kiryu"
msgid "So that's how he ended up in the Tojo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1192_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"All that time, Taiga never turned his back to me. Even when\r\n"
"it seemed like all hope was lost, he supported me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1204_Yasuko"
msgid ""
"He dropped out of high school, gave up on his dream of\r\n"
"becoming a teacher, even joined the yakuza for me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1216_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"So that's what you meant when you said you owe him your\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1228_Yasuko"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1240_Yasuko"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1312_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1360_Kiryu"
msgid ""

msgctxt "1372_Kiryu"

msgctxt "1384_Date"

msgctxt "1408_Date"
msgid ""

msgctxt "1420_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1444_Kiryu"
msgid "Oh, right. You mind taking a seat, Yasuko-san?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1456_Yasuko"
msgid "Um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1468_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Please. I just need to ask you something before we head out\r\n"
