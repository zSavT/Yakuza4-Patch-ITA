msgstr ""

msgctxt "4608_Kiryu"

msgctxt "4620_Maya"
msgid ""
"I think a woman should be devoted and try to stay next to her man as much "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4632_Maya"
msgid "But she says men get tired of that kind of thing and eventually leave you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4644_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I have to agree with her. Someone hanging around you all the time can be "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4656_Maya"
msgid "What? You think so too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4668_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Yeah. Don't get me wrong. If I love someone, I want to spend time with "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4680_Maya"
msgid "Well, I don't want to force myself on anyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4692_Kiryu"
msgid "Then you should be fine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4704_Maya"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4716_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Sure. As long as you consider the man's feelings, you won't come off as "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4728_Maya"
msgid ""
"Okay. I guess you have to be devoted while still leaving a little space "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4740_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"There's nothing wrong with being devoted. A man would be lucky to have such "
"a woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4752_Maya"
msgid "You agree with me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4764_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure. It's much better than having a woman who cheats on you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4776_Maya"
msgid ""
"Hehe. You look like a ladies' man, but you're actually sweet, aren't you? "
"<Color:7>♥<Color:Default>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4788_Kiryu"
msgid "Can't I be both?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4800_Maya"
msgid "Ha! I hadn't thought of that! I guess that's possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4812_Kiryu"
msgid "Heh. Good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4824_Kiryu"
msgid "That's a tricky issue. It depends on what the man wants."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4836_Maya"
msgid "Ah, so you want to stay neutral, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4848_Kiryu"
msgid "Huh? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4860_Maya"
msgid "There must be a type of woman you prefer, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4872_Kiryu"
msgid "Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4884_Maya"
msgid "So, which is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4896_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I can't say. I like having a woman around, but sometimes I want to be "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4908_Maya"
msgid "Oh. I didn't expect you to be so indecisive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4920_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4932_Maya"
msgid "Ugh... I'm tired."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4944_Kiryu"
msgid "What's wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4956_Maya"
msgid "Oh, I got stopped by a policeman on the way to work today."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4968_Maya"
msgid "I wasn't feeling well, so I wanted to tell him to get lost this time, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4980_Kiryu"
msgid "This time? You get questioned that often?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4992_Maya"
msgid "Yeah. Do I look that suspicious to you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5004_Kiryu"
msgid "Actually..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5016_Maya"
msgid ""
"Heh. Well, I'm pretty used to it by now. I'd get stopped every day when I "
"was in junior high school."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5028_Kiryu"
msgid "Every day? Wow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5040_Maya"
msgid "It's a lot better now. Maybe two or three times a month."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5052_Kiryu"
msgid "That's a pretty big difference."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5064_Maya"
msgid "Yeah. I think I don't stand out as much in Kamurocho."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5076_Kiryu"
msgid "But you still get stopped sometimes, so you must still stand out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5088_Maya"
msgid "Really? I like attention, but not that kind!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5100_Kiryu"
msgid "You'd think the cops would stop bothering you once they remember your face."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5112_Maya"
msgid "I think I know their faces better than they know mine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5124_Kiryu"
msgid "Heh, oh well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5136_Kiryu"
msgid "I get stopped sometimes myself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5148_Maya"
msgid "You do? Maybe we should start a club!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5160_Maya"
msgid "It must be because you have a wild and dangerous look about you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5172_Kiryu"
msgid "Maybe. I usually just run away. I don't have the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5184_Maya"
msgid "But wouldn't that make you seem more suspicious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5196_Kiryu"
msgid "That's why I make sure they don't catch me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5208_Maya"
msgid "Hahaha! It sounds like you're an expert. I should try running next time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5220_Kiryu"
msgid "You could try to wear less flashy clothes. You do sort of stand out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5232_Maya"
msgid "But all the girls wear clothes like this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5244_Kiryu"
msgid "So why do they stop you all the time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5256_Maya"
msgid "I don't know. I guess I have some kind of suspicious aura."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5268_Kiryu"
msgid "They probably want an excuse to talk with a famous model."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5280_Maya"
msgid ""
"Ha! You'll make me blush if you keep talking like that. "

msgctxt "5292_Kiryu"
msgid "Heh, sorry."

msgctxt "5304_Maya"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5316_Kiryu"
msgid "You're not talking about me, are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5328_Maya"
msgid "No, no. You're fine. A bit of swagger suits you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5340_Kiryu"
msgid "If you say so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5352_Maya"
msgid "But a lot of guys these days are all talk. They think they're so special."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5364_Kiryu"
msgid "They're fooling themselves. They think they're being cool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5376_Maya"
msgid ""
"Right. They're trying so hard to impress girls, but it just ends up "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5388_Maya"
msgid "Being polite makes a much better impression."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5400_Kiryu"
msgid "They're young. They don't know any better."

msgctxt "5424_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5436_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Young guys don't know what manners are. If you don't know someone, you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5448_Maya"
msgid ""
"That's right! And it's not just young people. We get older customers like "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5460_Maya"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5472_Kiryu"

msgid ""
"I hate people who can only make themselves feel better by tearing other "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5496_Kiryu"

"There's nothing you can do about it. Young guys don't have any "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5508_Maya"
msgid "Why can't they just wait until they've got something real to brag about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5520_Kiryu"
msgid "Because they can't. If you look weak, the other guys eat you alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "5532_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"The first impression is particularly important. You have to take the "

msgctxt "5556_Maya"

msgctxt "5604_Maya"

msgctxt "5664_Maya"
msgid "Yes!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5700_Maya"
msgid "But I'd still like to know!"

msgctxt "5712_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Well, it depends. Sometimes it's the man's fault, and sometimes it's the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5724_Maya"

msgid ""
"I don't know, but your friend's relationship isn't healthy. She should "

msgctxt "5760_Maya"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5772_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5784_Maya"
msgid "Yes. I can't forgive that kind of betrayal."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "5808_Maya"

msgctxt "5868_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "7776_Kiryu"

"It's the fashion industry that makes the trends. They decide what's going "

" But I've never seen you upset. Do you try to keep your negative feelings "

msgctxt "9984_Maya"
msgid "So I don't go out and party like I used to anymore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "9996_Kiryu"

"Maybe you were too wild as a teenager. Besides, everyone's got to cut back "

"Oh, you just don't look like you worry about that kind of thing. You're "

"Well, you can't be a teenager forever. Sooner or later, you have to start "

msgctxt "10260_Kiryu"
msgid "They do? That's a surprise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "10272_Maya"
