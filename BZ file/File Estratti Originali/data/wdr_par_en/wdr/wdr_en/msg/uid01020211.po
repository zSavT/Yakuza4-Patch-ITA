msgstr ""

msgctxt "556_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"But that only makes you want her more... and before you know it, she's the "

msgctxt "640_Kido"
msgid "So Arai-aniki really did it, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "652_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I couldn't believe it, either. Arai-san's too smart to get trigger happy "

msgctxt "664_Kido"
msgid "And nobody's seen him since?"
