msgctxt "248_Ibuki"

msgctxt "260_Ibuki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "284_Ibuki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "308_Ibuki"

msgctxt "320_Ibuki"
msgid ""
"He's always getting into arguments with the staff and customers, and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "332_Ibuki"
msgid "The problem isn't that he's lazy or anything. If anything, he's too serious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I get the picture. He thinks he's giving it one hundred percent, but that's "
"not necessarily how everybody else sees it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Ibuki"
msgid ""
"Exactly. But, unfortunately, I can't follow him around his workplace and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "368_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Well, he's not a kid anymore. He should be picking up this stuff on his own "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Ibuki"
msgid ""

"I'm sure you've got a lot on your plate, though. Plenty of other people "
