msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Lily"
msgid "That's awful..."

msgctxt "548_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"But it's true. The bank I worked at set me up then cut me loose. The woman "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Lily"
msgid "So how did having me work at your club test you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Lily"
msgid "No, it's okay. I feel really lucky to have met you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but luck isn't something that just finds you. You have to get out "
