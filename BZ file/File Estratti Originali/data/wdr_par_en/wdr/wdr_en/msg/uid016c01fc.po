msgctxt "536_Maya"

msgctxt "548_Kiryu"

msgctxt "560_Kiryu"

"Do you eat liver? Liver contains arachidonic acid, which reverses aging in "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Maya"
msgid ""
"I love liver sashimi. I especially like to change up the flavor when I eat "

msgctxt "728_Kiryu"
msgid "Then you've probably got a good memory, thanks to the liver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Maya"

msgctxt "764_Kiryu"

msgctxt "788_Kiryu"
msgid "Is she? So she's got a slim figure, right?"

msgctxt "800_Maya"

msgctxt "812_Kiryu"

"Sweet sake is all the rage now. Women like to order it when eating over at "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Maya"
msgid "Oh, I love sweet sake! It's so delicious and easy to drink."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"And it's got a low alcohol percentage, so even you won't drink yourself "
"under the table."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Maya"
msgid "True. It's the perfect drink for a girls night out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "908_Kiryu"
msgid "Did you try out 777 Town yet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "920_Maya"
msgid "I did! It's really addictive."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, I guess there's no proof..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Maya"
msgid ""
"That's right. If it was real, it would've been caught on a security camera "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Kiryu"
msgid "Try out the footbaths at Yunosono Hot Springs yet?"

msgctxt "1220_Kiryu"
msgid "Have you been drinking sweet sake lately?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Maya"
