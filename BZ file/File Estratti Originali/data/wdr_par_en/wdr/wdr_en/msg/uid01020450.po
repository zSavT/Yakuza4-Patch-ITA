msgctxt "620_Majima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Shibata"
msgid "It's a tiny, cramped noodle shop at the edge of town."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Shibata"

msgctxt "728_Shibata"
msgid ""

msgctxt "752_Shibata"

msgctxt "812_Shibata"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Majima"
msgid "But why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Shibata"
msgid "To start a war."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Majima"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Shibata"
msgid ""
"Sasai's creating a reason for the Tojo\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Shibata"
msgid ""
"And what better way is there than to anger\r\n"

msgctxt "896_Shibata"
msgid "Good question."
msgstr ""
