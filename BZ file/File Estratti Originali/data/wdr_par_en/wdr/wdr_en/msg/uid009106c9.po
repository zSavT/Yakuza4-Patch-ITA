msgctxt "348_Kiryu"

msgctxt "384_Akaishi"

msgctxt "432_Akaishi"

"Reign may not have thought that way before, but I get the sense that he's "

msgctxt "444_Kiryu"
msgid "...I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Akaishi"
msgid ""
"Just be careful of the other Slumdogs that don't share Reign's ideals. They "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Kiryu"
msgid "So, you're Reign?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Reign"
msgid ""
"Yeah, that's right. And you're the Fourth Chairman of the Tojo Clan and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Reign"
msgid ""
"And now, you provide assistance to the Kamurocho Guard, becoming the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Kiryu"
msgid "So what's your story?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Reign"
msgid "You could say I'm an organizer of Kamurocho's disenfranchised expatriates."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Reign"
msgid ""
"I'll mention this just so there are no misunderstandings. I'm not a member "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Kiryu"
msgid "But you do seem to know a lot. Where'd you get all that information?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Reign"
msgid ""
"I heard about you being the champion from other fighters while I was "
"competing at the Coliseum."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Reign"
msgid ""
"Of course, when I was there, you had already long since become the stuff of "
"legend."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"And someone as well-informed as you just happens to be not only a "
"foreigner, but a gang leader? What are you after, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "684_Reign"
msgid ""
"To most foreigners, this town is just a short stop in their lives. Earn as "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Reign"

"Even small time crooks can become a powerful force if they stick together. "
"That's what organized crime is all about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "720_Reign"
msgid ""
"Imagine that. Forming a group consisting of nothing but foreigners. Just "
"think of the possibilities."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "732_Kiryu"
msgid "You'd become the dominant syndicate."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "744_Reign"
msgid ""
"Indeed. You can see why yakuza are frightened of what would happen if we "
"banded together. They've posed an obstacle to us in the past."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Reign"
msgid ""
"That's why I've considered admitting young Japanese as well as foreigners, "
"with strong physical and intellectual capabilities."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Reign"
msgid ""
"If I were to do so, we'd become quite powerful in the next few years, don't "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Reign"
msgid "And then you came along."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Reign"
msgid ""
"If I defeat you, young Japanese fighters will be falling over themselves to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"All right, I get the picture. It's all the more reason I can't let you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Reign"
msgid "What an odd choice of words..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"People like you rub me the wrong way. Who chose you to speak for all "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Reign"
msgid ""
"I must say, I'm disappointed. It seems you don't understand what I'm trying "
"to achieve. I had hoped you would."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Reign"
msgid ""
"You've ruled the underworld, dominated the Coliseum, and saved the Tojo "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Reign"
msgid ""
"Yakuza, gangs, the people of Kamurocho... What kind of a leader are you "
"trying to be to them, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"The whole idea of being a leader is flawed from the start. People should be "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Reign"
msgid ""
"Hmph. What a waste of time. We have nothing else to discuss. It's time for "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Reign"
msgid ""
"You may be a famous champion, but I'm no slouch myself. I should tell you "
"that in one hundred matches, I've never once suffered defeat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I see... And here I thought giving out free information was your only "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Reign"
msgid "So, you've got quick wit to match your strength, huh? Better brace yourself!"
